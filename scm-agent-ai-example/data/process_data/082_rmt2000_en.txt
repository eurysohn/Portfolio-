Explanatory notes All references to dollars ($) are to United States dollars, unless otherwise stated. "Tons" refers to metric tons, unless otherwise stated. Details and percentages presented in tables do not necessarily add up to the totals because of rounding. Two dots indicate that data are not available or are not separately reported. A hyphen signifies that the amount is nil, or less than half the unit used. In some tables, the data shown for earlier years have been revised and updated, and therefore differ from those shown in previous issues of the Review. This relates in particular to the distribution of world tonnage according to country groups, specifically the classification of major open-registry countries. Up to the 1994 edition of the Review, the majority of tables included five countries in this group, namely, Bahamas, Bermuda, Cyprus, Liberia and Panama, while some tables also included Malta and Vanuatu. In order to improve consistency and to reflect practices of ship registration, Malta and Vanuatu have been included in all tables referring to major open-registry countries. This reclassification primarily affects the share of developing countries in Europe in total world tonnage. In the tables and the text, the use of the term "countries" refers to countries, territories or areas.

x INTRODUCTION The Review of Maritime Transport is an annual publication prepared by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development . Its purpose is to identify the main developments in world maritime transport and to provide relevant statistical data. It focuses on the development of the maritime activities in developing countries as compared with other groups of countries, and to the correlation between the development of global trade and maritime transport activities in general. In order to maintain a balance between the information requirements of data users and those of providers of maritime transport services, this year's Review has more information on e- commerce transport efficiency. Regional developments in African economic and maritime transport are the subject of this year's special chapter. in a chapter on trade SUMMARY OF MAIN DEVELOPMENTS Development of the world economy and seaborne trade v World output grew in 1999 by 2.7 per cent over 1998. The developed market-economy countries experienced growth of 2.5 per cent over the previous year, while developing countries (including China) recorded an average increase of 3.4 per cent. In 2000, the output growth of the world is expected to be 3.5-4.5 per cent while the output of developed market-economy countries and developing countries is expected to be 3.0- 4.0 per cent and 5.0-5.5 per cent respectively. v The growth of world merchandise exports continued to slow in 1999, to 3.9 per cent, as compared to 4.7 per cent in 1998, while that of imports increased slightly to 5.3 per cent from 4.5 per cent in the previous year. The slowdown in exports is accounted for by a contraction of exports in the transition economies as well as slower export growth in developing countries. The import improvement in 1999 was due mainly to a recovery in developing countries and also to sustained growth in developed market economy countries. v The total industrial production index of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) rose moderately in 1999 by in 1998 3.0 per cent (1995=100). This positive development was primarily due to the United States industrial production, which grew by 3.5 per cent in 1999. to 113.4 from 110.1 v World trade recorded seaborne its fourteenth consecutive annual increase in 1999, reaching a record high of 5.23 billion tons. Annual growth, however, declined at a rate of 1.3 per cent, the lowest since 1987. Preliminary data available indicate that global maritime trade growth in 2000 is expected to be 2.0 per cent. v Total maritime activities measured in ton-miles in global trade decreased to the minimal level of 21,480 billion ton-miles in 1999, in comparison with 21,492 billion ton-miles in the previous year. Development of the world fleet v ?The world merchant fleet expanded to 799.0 million deadweight tons (dwt) at the end of 1999, representing a 1.3 per cent increase over 1998. The relatively low rate of fleet expansion the balance between newbuilding reflects deliveries of 40.5 million dwt and tonnage broken up and lost of 30.7 million dwt, leaving a net gain of 9.8 million dwt. v In 1999, tonnage ownership fell marginally by 0.3 per cent in developed market-economy countries, while major open-registry countries and developing countries increased their fleet by 0.3 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively. The developing countries' share of tonnage registered in major open-registry countries has slowly increased, reaching about one third in 1999. On the other hand, the developed market-economy countries' share has pursued a downward trend,

representing about two thirds of the total tonnage registered in the major open-registry countries. xi Productivity of the world fleet and supply and demand in world shipping v The main operational productivity indicators for the world fleet developed favourably in 1999. Tons of cargo carried per dwt stood at 6.42, which was the same as in the previous year. v World total surplus tonnage stood at 23.7 million dwt in 1999 (the lowest in the 1990s), or 3.0 per cent of the 1999 world merchant fleet. The surplus capacity in the oil-tanker sector declined to 14.0 million dwt, or 5.0 per cent of the total world tanker fleet, in 1999, while overcapacity in the dry bulk sector decreased to 7.9 million dwt, accounting for 3.2 per cent of the world dry bulk fleet. Freight markets v In the transpacific trades, the average annual revenue per TEU on the eastbound leg in 1999 increased by 34 per cent as compared with that in the previous year. On the westbound routes, the average annual rates per TEU in 1999 declined by 18.1 per cent from those in 1998. In the Asia/Europe trades, the average annual rates per TEU on the Europe-Asia routes in 1999 declined by 17.9 per cent as compared with those in 1998, while those on the Asia-Europe routes rose by 19 per cent in 1999 from the average level in 1998. The transatlantic trade remained the most problematic liner market in 1999. The average annual rates in 1999 plummeted by 23 per cent in the United States to Europe trade and 11.7 per cent in the opposite direction as compared with those in 1998. v In 1999, the dry bulk supply and demand balance showed a clear improvement. The growth in demand was remarkably higher during the second half of 1999, specifically with strong demand from Asia for both coal and iron ore. v ?In 1999, world crude oil production decreased by 1.5 per cent from the level of 1998. Accordingly the overall volume of the seaborne crude oil trade decreased by 2.0 per cent. Nevertheless, the overall shipments of petroleum products in 1999 increased by 2.0 per cent. The average rates paid for VLCC transportation from the Middle East Gulf to the West was WS 46.16, as compared with WS 58.2 recorded in 1998. On voyages to Japan, the average was WS 50.78, whereas it was WS 66.9 in 1998. Total freight costs in world trade by groups v ?World total freight payments as a proportion of total import value (the freight factor) have been following a downward trend, falling from as high as 6.64 per cent in 1980 to 5.22 per cent in 1990 and further down to 5.06 per cent in 1998. The freight factor for the developed market-economy countries decreased to 4.07 per cent in 1998 as compared with 4.17 per cent in 1997, while that of developing countries increased very marginally to 8.06 per cent in 1998 from 8.04 per cent in the African 1997. developing countries was higher at 11.36 per cent in 1998. The freight factor for Port development v ?World container port traffic continued to expand in 1998 at a rate of 6.7 per cent over 1997, of which reaching 88.5 million TEUs (or 53.6 per cent, compared with 50.9 per cent in 1997) were handled at the ports of developing countries. 165.0 million TEUs, Trade and transport efficiency v ?Many transport companies, including maritime carriers, are now providing a variety of information on their services on the Internet as well as enabling customers to process transactions there has been a online. considerable growth of infomediaries, which are creating market places and exchanges for transportation services. A brief description and selected examples of infomediaries or Internet transport portals are provided. In recent years Review of regional developments: sub- Saharan African economic and maritime transport developments v Sub-Saharan Africa's overall economic activities regained some momentum in 1995, sustaining the favourable development until 1998, when the

xii growth rate fell below 3.0 per cent, continuing downwards in 1999. sub-Saharan African v Over the period from 1995 through 1999, the countries exports of expanded at an average annual rate of 4.0 per cent in value and 5.1 per cent in volume, with imports increasing at 6.3 per cent per year in value and 6.9 per cent in volume, as compared with 7.5 per cent in value and 8.0 per cent in volume for exports, and 6.5 per cent in value and the same growth in volume for imports of all developing countries. v The total merchant fleet of all the sub-Saharan African countries has been decreasing in terms of deadweight tons, from 0.29 per cent of the world total in 1980 to 0.23 per cent in 1990, reaching 0.15 per cent in 1999. Tankers and general cargo ships account for 46.4 per cent and 29.1 per cent respectively of the total sub-Saharan fleets. v Subregional exports of all non-liner dry cargoes have been expanding at the average annual growth rate of 3-4 per cent over the last several years. About 75 per cent of the total are exported from the southern coast. Imports have increased at the rate of 2-3 per cent annually. Nearly 60 per cent of total imports moved through the West coast of sub-Saharan Africa. Crude oil shipments from the western coast represent more than two thirds of the total, nearly half of which are destined for Exports of the United States. petroleum products, the majority of which are fuels for the United States, are fully dominated by the western coast while imports of petroleum products are mainly supplied equally by northern and southern Europe. v Total liner cargo of both imports (54 per cent) and exports (46 per cent) are increasing at the average annual rate of 2.1 per cent from 2.0 million TEUs in 1998 to nearly 2.1 million TEUs in 2000, of which approximately half are loaded or discharged on the southern coast. Trades with Europe, the biggest trade partner, have been increasing at the average annual rate of 2.3 per cent, reaching a share of nearly 60 per cent of the total trade in TEU terms in 2000. v Average freight costs of landlocked African countries in 1998 constituted a higher proportion of total import value (18.08 per cent) than the ratio for all African developing countries (11.36 per cent). In West Africa, Mali and Burkina Faso represented a higher percentage (29.57 per cent and 21.67 per cent respectively) in 1998. Rwanda registered the highest ratio in East Africa (29.91 per cent) while Malawi in southern Africa represented as much as 39.41 per cent.

Chapter I DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL SEABORNE TRADE The first chapter of the Review provides an overview of the demand for global maritime transport services, together with background information on the world economic situation, and a review and forecast of developments in world seaborne trade. A. WORLD ECONOMIC BACKGROUND 1 (a) World output General The year 1999 was characterized by a 1. comparatively significant stabilization of global economic conditions and a revival of world production and trade. The widely anticipated major disruptions, and even the threat of global recession, arising from the "Y2K computer bug", turned out to be a non-event. Although the risk itself may have been exaggerated, the absence of serious disruptions is perhaps a reflection of the massive business spending undertaken to cope with the problem. While there are no reliable figures, the most widely quoted amounts for such expenditure on global information technology (IT) range from $300 billion to $600 billion,2 which is some 1B2 per cent of global GDP. It appears to have provided an important boost to the world economy, giving an additional stimulus to the United States and helping recovery in East Asia. 2. World GDP picked up significantly in 1999 to reach 2.7 per cent, having slowed to 1.8 per cent in 1998 from 3.4 per cent in 1997 (see table 1). Of particular significance is the turnaround from recession to growth in Japan and the transition economies as well as the recovery in developing countries. The major factor underlying faster growth in developing countries as a whole was the steep rebound in East Asia, which more than compensated for a mild slowdown in Africa and a more severe one in Latin America. As a consequence, overall growth in developing countries was again higher than that of developed countries, for the second time since 1988. 3. In 1999, United States output continued to maintain its expansion at a pace faster than 4 per cent. Its sustained import demand was the main driving force behind the improvement in the global economy and particularly in Asia and Europe. Following its recession in 1998, the Japanese economy rebounded sharply in the first half of 1999 but slowed again later in the year. Growth in the European Union (EU) was significantly lower in 1999 than in 1998 but developments during the year were positive. Despite increased monetary and financial convergence, growth rates continued to diverge considerably among EU countries. Prospects and forecasts 4. While the prospects for the global economy have become considerably more optimistic since the end of 1999, the risk that global imbalances may create another financial disruption has become increasingly evident. The better-than-expected performance in 1999, in particular of the United States, East Asia and Brazil, has led to an upward revision of short-term forecasts of growth for all major economic regions. This tendency has been reinforced by the fact that the global economy has continued to gather strength as the expansion of demand and output has become more widespread. However, perceptions of such developments vary widely among various international organizations and other institutions. The forecast of world output growth in 2000 ranges from 3.5 per cent to 4.3 per cent, compared to an estimate of only 2.7 per cent, achieved in 1999. There are also significant differences in growth rates forecast for different regions. For example, there is much uncertainty associated with the widely expected slowdown of the United States economy and in Japan and Europe, while in the developing world there are the recovery

(b) Merchandise trades 5. There are already some clear signals that suggest that the United States economy is starting to slow from its rapid pace of growth at the turn of the year, while the vigour of economic activity in Europe appears to be broadening but without great momentum. This has led some forecasters to start to mark down their optimistic forecasts for these economies. Recovery in most developing economies in East Asia has been stronger than expected, but there are signs of deceleration. The slowdown in China appears to have bottomed out, but the Chinese authorities still consider stimulus necessary. While recovery in Latin America is under way, the situation in Argentina remains fragile, the financial crisis in Ecuador is unresolved, and the sustainability of Recent developments in international trade 6. The deep recession and rapid recovery in the diverse emerging markets, together with movements of commodity prices, including oil, have given rise to sharp swings in international trade flows over the past few years as well as to considerable shifts in the commodity terms of trade. The widespread decline in economic activity during 1997B1998 was accompanied by a slowdown in the growth of world trade volumes. The decline in trade in 1998 was discernible in varying degrees in all developing regions and in the transition economies, but it was especially sharp for African exports and Asian imports.

The revival in world trade in 1999 in the wake of 7. a similar pattern. The increase was greater in value than in volume on account of disparate movements in the prices of internationally traded goods and services. With the major exception of the transition economies, there was a sharp turnaround in all regions, particularly in value terms, as price declines levelled off. The return of financial stability and improved growth prospects in the crisis-stricken Asian economies led to a modest recovery in certain non-oil commodity prices of interest to developing countries. The expectation for 2000 is for a moderate 8. acceleration in the growth of the volume of world trade, mainly as the result of somewhat faster growth on the part of the EU economies, and economic recovery in Latin America and the transition economies. However, prospects are significantly dependent on developments in the pace and pattern of demand generation, primarily in industrial countries, as well as on movements in exchange rates, and hence on international capital flows. Trends in imports and exports 9. The volume of world imports grew by some 5 per cent in 1999, a modest improvement over 1998, when it slowed sharply as the combined effects of the emerging- market financial crises resulted in massive cuts in imports in East Asia, Latin America and the transition economies (table 2). The improvement in 1999 was due mainly to a recovery in developing countries and also to sustained growth in developed countries, albeit at a relatively lower rate than in the previous year, whereas import volumes in the transition economies contracted by 10 per cent. 10. Among the developed countries, the United States economy maintained double-digit growth in import volumes for the third successive year. There was also a surge in Japan following a decline in 1998. By contrast, there was a significant deceleration in the EU countries. In the developing world, performance was also mixed. In Latin America, the volume of imports contracted after a relatively rapid expansion in the previous year. In Africa it stagnated, following moderate growth in 1998. For developing Asia, however, there was a sharp upturn from a contraction of almost 10 per cent in 1998 to an increase of some 7 per cent, in large part due to the impressive rebound in East Asia. The volume of world exports is estimated to have 11. risen less than in 1998. The slowdown is accounted forby a contraction of exports in the transition economies as well as somewhat slower export growth in developing the economic recovery in East Asia followed countries. For developed countries as a whole the export volume growth rate was maintained at the previous year's level. The sharp rebound in Japan, together with a high rate of expansion for the third successive year in the United States, compensated for the deceleration in the EU. Among the developing regions, there was a notable rebound in Africa and Asia, in contrast to a moderate slowdown in Latin America. (c) OECD countries' industrial production 12. The industrial production of the OECD countries is another fundamental indicator for the global maritime transport sector. In 1999, the total OECD industrial production index (1995-100) rose moderately by 3.0 per cent to 113.4 from 110.1 in 1998, when it experienced a relatively poor increase of 1.8 per cent. The OECD's positive development sustained in 1999 was primarily due to the United States industrial production, which grew by 3.5 per cent, while the European OECD countries and Japan experienced below-average growth of 1.5 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively. World seaborne trade increased by only 1.3 per cent in 1999 as compared to 1998, when it increased by 2.2 per cent (see graph 1). B. WORLD SEABORNE TRADE (a) Overall seaborne trade 13. Expanding world seaborne trade recorded its fourteenth consecutive annual increase in 1999, reaching a record high of 5.23 billion tons. Annual growth, however, slowed to a rate of 1.3 per cent. Sustainable demand in the United States and the Asian recovery were the main engines of the global trade expansion in 1999. The strength of United States private consumption helped the recovery in Asia. In 1999, the United States recorded a continuous import growth of consumer goods. Import expansion of Asia in 1999 offset the import contraction in terms of dry cargo volume in the previous year. On the other hand, crude oil imports to Europe from non- European countries registered a deceleration. Countries of Central and Eastern Europe recorded a marginal increase in imports, mainly due to the slowdown of imports into Russia and the Ukraine. Imports into Africa increased slightly in 1999. Socialist countries of Asia substantially increased their dry cargo imports in 1999. Despite relatively lower intraregional trade, Latin America recorded a favourable export expansion of dry cargo in 1999. Asian export growth improved substantially as

Crude oil exports of Africa decreased considerably, but dry cargo increased moderately in 1999. Socialist countries of Asia recorded a moderate increase in exports in 1999. Preliminary data available indicate that global maritime trade growth in 2000 is expected to be 2.0 per cent (see graph 2 and table 3).

Estimates. (b) Seaborne trade in tankers Crude oil production 14. In 1999, world crude oil production decreased by 1.5 per cent or nearly 1.0 million barrels per day from the previous year. This decrease reflects production cuts in the producing regions, specifically the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). OPEC output declined by 3.9 per cent to 26.745 million barrels per day as compared to 27.828 million barrels per day in 1998. NonBOPEC production rose slightly by 0.2 per cent to 39.357 million barrels per day from 39.265 million barrels per day in the previous year. Total growth in production was marginalized, mainly because of OPEC's production curtailment. United States production decreased substantially by 5.2 per cent to 5.916 million barrels per day in 1999 as compared with its output in 1998, while Canada's output was also down by 4.9 per cent to 2.072 million barrels per day. Mexico significantly reduced its output by 5.3 per cent, to 2.913 million barrels per day. Output of the Middle East members of OPEC declined by 3.2 per cent to 18.508 million barrels per day in 1999, while other OPEC output was also reduced, dropping by 5.4 per cent to 8.237 million barrels per day. Meanwhile, North Sea production increased strongly by 7.7 per cent to 5.967 million barrels per day, and Russia's production remained almost unchanged, standing at 5.967 million barrels per day in 1999. All other countries' total production decreased by 1.5 per cent to 13.300 million barrels per day in 1999 as compared to 13.077 million barrels per day in the previous year.3 OPEC's oil production restraint and 15. the consequent considerable price increase on world markets resulted in less trade in crude oil in 1999. Thus, crude oil shipments, accounting for 75 per cent of total oil trade, declined by about 2.0 per cent in 1999, while petroleum products rose 2.0 per cent. Overall petroleum shipments in 1999 declined by 1.0 per cent in terms of trade volume from the level of the previous year. In 2000, when petroleum markets tighten and OPEC's production restraint eases, total tanker cargo volume growth is expected to rebound to around 2.0 per cent.

7 Crude oil shipments In 1999, the world's crude oil shipments 16. decreased significantly by 2.0 per cent to 1,600 million tons from 1,633 million tons recorded in the previous year. The trade structure of crude oil continues to change. The United States has been diversifying its imports from the Middle East Gulf to other regions such as Latin America and West Africa. European countries have been procuring more crude oil from European sources, relying less on other markets, in particular the Middle East Gulf producers. On the other hand, Asian economies including Japan remain largely dependent on Middle East Gulf oil. In 1999, OPEC's sustained production cut reduced export volume from most of the cartel's members. Exports from the Middle East Gulf were constrained by the production cuts by several OPEC members, although the reduction was offset somewhat by increased exports from Iraq. The volume from West Africa declined as a result of Nigeria's reduced output. Reductions in Venezuela, and in Mexico (a non-OPEC member) also curbed crude oil exports from Latin America, while Indonesia's restraint helped to trim the total volume from South-East Asia. As a result, crude oil imports fell in 1999 in major import markets. In the United States, crude oil imports declined slightly in 1999, despite rising demand. A similar decline was observed in crude oil importing countries in Asia. Over the next couple of years, crude oil seaborne trade is likely to return to an annual growth of 2 per cent, which approximately matches global oil-demand growth. This trade will be led by Middle East Gulf shipments to Asia, which represent part of a pattern of regionalization in the global crude oil trade. Latin America will increase its supply to North America, while Eastern Europe, mainly the former Soviet Union, and West Africa will supply Western Europe. Petroleum product shipments 17. The global trade in petroleum products in 1999 continued to increase steadily by 2.0 per cent to 560 million tons. One of the reasons for this sustained growth is the recovery of Asian demand, specifically the Far East newly industrialized economies (NIEs). Half of the NIEs' petroleum product imports are intra-NIEs shipments, the remainder being obtained from Japan, the United States and the Middle East Gulf. India commenced full-scale production at several refineries in 1999, thus reducing the volume of its off-shore procurements, mainly from the Middle East Gulf. In other major import markets, no significant changes were observed. The United States demand remained steady, for petroleum products comparatively more being imported from Latin America and Europe than from the Middle East Gulf. European demand remains more regionalized, thus resulting in less imports from non- European countries. This growth trend in volume terms and the prevailing pattern of trade are expected to continue for the next couple of years. (c) Dry cargo shipments General developments including commodities containerized 18. In 1999, overall dry cargo shipments grew at a rate of 3.0 per cent, reaching approximately 2,970 million tons, consisting of main dry bulk cargo (1,233 million tons), minor dry bulk cargo (762 million tons) and other cargo dry (975 million tons). This figure is down from the 3.7 per cent growth recorded in 1998. According to the preliminary data available, the growth of seaborne trade of total dry cargo in 2000 is expected to drop further to 2.0 per cent. The increase in main dry bulk commodities, which make up nearly 42 per cent of the total dry cargo trade, will continue to be supported by coal shipments with its trade expected to grow at more than 4 per cent in 2000. Limited growth of iron ore shipments is anticipated, while shipments of bauxite, alumina and phosphate rock will remain unchanged. Forecasts are difficult to make for the seaborne grain trade mainly because of unpredictable harvests, which primarily depend on weather conditions. World crude steel production 19. World crude steel production in 1999 increased by 1.3 per cent to 787 million tons, which is the second largest quantity after the volume of 800 million tons which was registered in 1997. Asia's production regained momentum in 1999, increasing by 3.6 per cent to 308 million tons or 39.2 per cent of the world total. Most of this expansion was attributable to the increased volume in China, with its production growing by 8.0 per cent to 124 million tons or 15.7 per cent of the world total. Production in India, Japan and the Republic of Korea returned to a favourable production course, registering increases of 3.5, 0.7 and 2.9 per cent respectively. Their combined output of 160 million tons was 20.3 per cent of the world total. On the other hand, the European Union's production shrank by 3.1 per cent to 155 million tons, or 19.7 per cent of the world total, mainly due to the decreases in Germany (-4.5 per cent), Italy (-3.3 per cent)

8 and the United Kingdom (-5.9 per cent). Among the major producers in the European Union, only France recorded a positive but marginal increase of 0.4 per cent. The production of the United States declined by 1.4 per cent to 97 million tons or 12.4 per cent of the world total. The combined volume of the three major crude steel- producing regions, Asia, the European Union and North America, increased by 1.0 per cent to 593 million tons in 1999, and dominated world crude steel production with a combined share of 75.4 per cent of world output.4 World steel consumption to 699 million 20. World steel consumption in 1999 increased tons, marginally by 0.8 per cent approaching the record level of approximately 700 million tons in 1997. The steel consumption of Asia increased by 6.0 per cent to 303 million tons, while that of North America and the European Union declined by 5.9 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively to 135 million tons each. The combined steel consumption of these three major regions increased slightly by 1.2 per cent to 572 million tons or 81.8 per cent of total world consumption. The consumption quantity of the three major regions corresponds to their production quantity (593 million tons). Based on the analysis by country, China's consumption in 1999 increased by 9.7 per cent to 125 million tons. Conversely, the Japanese steel market declined by 2.8 per cent to 68 million tons. Civil engineering was the only market showing growth in 1999. However, the Government of Japan's stimulus packages encouraged steel consumption. The Republic of Korea's steel consumption recovered remarkably by 28.9 per cent to 32 million tons. The United States reduced its consumption by 7.3 per cent to 109 million tons, registering, however, an import surge from Japan and the Republic of Korea.5 Iron ore trade 21. Although there was a small increase in total world steel production with Asia's increase offset by declines in the European Union and the United States, the total volume of seaborne trade in iron ore in 1999 decreased by 1.7 per cent to 410 million tons. In 1999, changes in the regional distribution of steel production have affected iron ore import patterns, with trades into Asia increasing, but those into Europe decreasing. This change in the distribution of steel production has impacted the exporters of iron ore. Exports from Australia to Asia increased by 3 per cent, whereas those from Brazil, which supplies Europe, declined by 5 per cent. Canada's iron ore exports were reduced significantly by 14 per cent and Sweden's trade also fell 13 per cent. On the basis of the preliminary data it is expected that total world iron ore shipments in 2000 will recover as demand strengthens in Asia (Japan, China, the Far Eastern NIEs) and Northern Europe.6 Coal trade 22. Coal shipments were again the largest dry bulk cargo in 1999, increasing by 1.5 per cent to 480 million tons. Thermal coal expanded by 3.3 per cent to 306 million tons, whereas coking coal decreased by 1.7 per cent to 174 million tons. Total sales from Australia, the largest exporter, showed continued strong growth in 1999, increasing by 4 per cent. Australia strengthened her dominant supply position to Japan, while Japan's imports from the United States and Canada fell. Overall coal exports from the United States dropped by 23 per cent to approximately 40 million tons from 52 million tons in 1998. Canada also reduced its coal exports by 3 per cent in 1999. Most of the increased demand of the Far Eastern NIEs was satisfied by the supply from Australian, Chinese and South-East Asian mines rather than those in North America. China's exports rose significantly by 19 per cent while Indonesia's exports increased similarly by about 20 per cent. Shipments to the Indian subcontinent remained strong, benefitting Australian and other Asian suppliers. South Africa's exports in 1999 are expected to decrease by about 3 per cent. Various forecasts indicate that total coal shipments will grow significantly by more than 4 per cent in 2000.7 Grain trade 23. World grain shipments increased by 7.1 per cent to 210 million tons in 1999. On the supply side, exports from the United States expanded remarkably by 18.3 per cent to 87.9 million tons, while Canada's exports increased by 6.2 per cent to 19.3 million tons. Australia's supply increased by 8.7 per cent to 20.6 million tons, whereas Argentina's exports plummeted by as much as 28.7 per cent to 17.3 million tons. Exports from the European Union to third countries expanded by about 17.2 per cent as compared with the results of the previous year, reaching 18.2 million tons. On the import side, shipments moving from Australia to the Far East and from Europe to the Middle East in 1999 were greater than in previous years. Japanese demand is expected to shrink by about 5 per cent in 1999. In contrast, demand by the other Far Eastern countries in that year is expected to

9 have recovered from its decline of 4.5 per cent in 1998. While the United States serves as a major supplier to world markets, its producers will be confronted with intensified competition from other suppliers, including Latin American and European producers, as well as those in Australia. According to preliminary data, the overall grain market will slow again in 2000 as small declines in European and Middle Eastern demand will offset an equally small improvement in Asian demand.8 (d) Liner shipments of containerized cargo 24. Total world liner shipments of containerized cargo in 1999 are expected to reach approximately 50 million TEUs C an increase of 1.0 per cent compared with the volume of the previous year, reflecting a substantial recovery from the Asian crisis and its aftermath. In 1999, the Asian economies continued to push up the trade volume of major liner routes such as Transpacific, Europe/Asia and intra-Asia. On the other hand, the sustained expansion of Asian exports has been causing a serious trade imbalance between the trade routes in the Transpacific and the Europe/Asia trades. from In 1999, the eastbound Transpacific trade 25. the strong expansion recorded a continuation of representing 5.5 million TEUs in 1999. The strong import growth of the United States encouraged cargo movement mainly the Republic of Korea, Taiwan Province of China and other South-East Asian countries. Growth will slow in 2000, as greater development in import and export trades with Japan and Hong Kong (China) remains uncertain. The Transpacific westbound trade increased marginally to 3.3 million TEUs in 1999 with greater expansion expected in 2000. The Europe/Asia trade produced a relatively small increase in volume in 1998, with a drop in eastbound business offsetting an increase in westbound trade. Recovery was clearly under way in 1999 with a total volume of 3.6 million TEUs in the westbound trade and 2.7 million TEUs on the eastbound leg. The imbalance will remain in 2000, as eastbound trade will increase slowly, but westbound trade with consumer goods and electrical goods, accounting for over 60 per cent of the total, will accelerate. Transatlantic trade in 1999 was made up of strong westbound trade (European exports to the United States) of 1.7 million TEUs and flat eastbound trade (United States exports to Europe), representing 1.4 million TEUs. In 2000, eastbound traffic will grow moderately, while westbound growth will slow considerably as the United States imports from Northern Europe are expected to decline from the high growth rate in 1999. 26. Intra-Asia liner trade, the world's largest, is growing again strongly and steadily, with a total volume of 9.7 million TEUs moved in 1999. China is the major market for its Asian neighbours, accounting for 30 per cent of the intra-Asian imports and growing at 16 per cent in 1999, with a 6 per cent forecast in 2000. Other outstanding examples of recovery are Taiwan Province of China and the Republic of Korea, each growing at about 15 per cent in 1999 with a 13 per cent forecast in 2000. Hong Kong (China), which accounted for 14 per cent of the imports in 1999, will grow again in 2000. Japan, representing 13 per cent of the imports, is expected to expand at 6 per cent in 1999 and to be flat in 2000. The combined import volume of South-East Asian countries, making up 26 per cent of the imports, increased by 4 per cent in 1999 and is likely to expand at 8 per cent in 2000. From the export perspective, Taiwan Province of China is leading the market, accounting for 24 per cent of intra- Asian exports; these grew by 14 per cent in 1999 and are expected to increase by 8 per cent in 2000. It is also expected that Japanese and South-East Asian exports will grow faster in 2000 than in 1999, and that China's exports, accounting for 16 per cent of the intra-Asia total in 1999, will expand at the rate of 10 per cent in 2000.9 (e) World shipments by country groups 27. World seaborne trade in 1999 increased by 1.3 per cent compared with its figure in the previous year. Summarized data on world seaborne trade by major cargo segments and country groups are shown in table 4 and graph 3. The share of developed market-economy countries in goods loaded and unloaded in 1999 is 43.9 per cent and 65.5 per cent respectively of total world volume. For these countries, crude oil and petroleum products account for 11.7 per cent and 33.0 per cent of total world exports, while imports account for 71.3 per cent for crude oil and 72.0 per cent for petroleum products. In terms of the regional groupings, Europe, including the Mediterranean and United Kingdom, and intra-regional trades, remains the most important exporter and importer of crude oil and petroleum products, its combined share of the world total representing 14.6 per cent for exports and 29.0 per cent for imports. By country, the United States and Japan are the major importers of crude oil and petroleum

In the dry bulk segment, developed market-economy countries remain at 63.2 per cent for exports and 61.3 per cent for imports. Based on regional distribution, Europe is also the largest dry cargo market for exports and imports, with 21.2 per cent and 32.5 per cent respectively. A constant increase in the volume of intra-regional trade has been observed, while overall dry cargo export and import trades with third country groups are comparatively flat or slightly downward. By country, the United States' exports in 1999 were driven by grain shipments, representing an 18 per cent increase over the previous year. The increase in cargo unloaded is mainly attributable to the continued expansion of liner cargo from Asia. In 1999, Australia three major commodities C iron ore, coal and grain C by 3.0, 4.0 and nearly 9 per cent respectively. Japan's coal imports from Australia in 1999 expanded, whilst those from the United States and Canada weakened. Its demand for grain shrank in 1999, offsetting somewhat the expansion of other main dry bulk commodities. its exports of increased 28. The developing countries' share in total world exports remained at 50.5 per cent, while their share of imports stood at 27.8 per cent in 1999. Their trade the case of structure in terms of volume reflected a sharp contrast with that of developed market-economy countries. The developing countries' combined share in crude oil and its products represented 76.8 per cent for exports and 24.0 per cent for imports in the world total, while in the developed market-economy countries their combined share was at 17.2 per cent for exports and 71.5 per cent for imports. In the dry cargo segment, the developed market-economy countries share as a group in exports and imports represented 63.2 per cent and 61.3 per cent, which was almost double the developingcountries' group share of 31.3 per cent for exports and 30.5 per cent for imports. There are some variations observable in the 29. volume of goods loaded or unloaded among the developing countries, specifically in Asia. In 1999, Asian countries maintained 26.1 per cent and 18.8 per cent for exports and imports respectively of total world trade. The majority of crude oil exports (44.5 per cent of the world total or 53.0 per cent of the developing countries' total) was shipped in 1999 from Western Asia (the Middle East Gulf). Petroleum products loaded (37.0 per cent of the world total or 65.7 per cent of the developing countries' total) were traded mainly in the intra-Asian markets, including increasing Japan. The

13 share in the volume of dry cargo loaded reflected primarily the expansion of Asia's containerized trades in both international and intra-Asian markets. In the import segment, Asian countries kept a relatively higher share of 21.9 per cent in world shipments or 71.8 per cent of the developing countries' total. The majority of dry cargo unloaded consisted of three main dry bulk commodities from non-Asian countries. 30. The share of shipments for the developing countries of America has remained stable at 13-14 per cent for exports and unchanged at 4.3 per cent for imports since the early 1990s. Crude oil and petroleum products from Mexico and Venezuela, iron ore from Brazil and grain from Argentina are dominant in the region's outward trade volume, boosting the region's total dry cargo share to 12.8 per cent of the world total, while the dry cargo imports of the region remains at 4.1 per cent. The majority of these represent trades of manufactures with the United States and Europe, and imports of coking coal from North America and Australia. 31. The share of goods loaded by African developing countries continued to shrink to slightly lower than 10 per cent of the world total. In 1999 their share in loading crude oil, petroleum products and dry cargo was 22.7 per cent, 5.3 per cent, and 3.7 per cent respectively in total world trade. Crude oil shipments are generated mainly in Western and Northern Africa. Coal exports from southern Africa share a major portion of dry cargo exports. For imports, their trades have been stagnant at the low level of 4 per cent of world trade since the 1980s, distributed evenly over crude oil and petroleum products, and the dry cargo group. The share of countries in Central and Eastern Europe in 1999 continued to be stagnant at 3.7 per cent for loading, mainly owing to a marginal increase in both crude oil and its products. Their imports have remained at 3.1 per cent since the middle of the 1990s. Figure for the socialist countries in Asia have primarily reflected the trade activities of China, which are composed mainly of exports of coal and manufactures, and imports of iron ore. (f) Demand for shipping services ton-miles decreased 32. Table 5 provides data on total demand for shipping services in terms of ton-miles. World seaborne trade in volume increased marginally by 1.3 per cent to 5,129 million tons in 1999, whilst the total shipping performance measured to in 21,480 billion ton-miles in 1999 from 21,492 billion ton- miles in the previous year. This represents the second consecutive decline after 14 years of continuous growth. By commodity, crude oil shipments in volume dropped by 2.0 per cent due to OPEC'c production cuts, whereas oil products increased by 2.0 per cent. In terms of transportation performance, crude oil decreased by 3.8 per cent to 7,500 billion ton-miles, whilst petroleum products increased by 2.0 per cent to 2,010 billion ton-miles. The decrease in ton-miles for crude oil was attributable mainly to the shortening of average transport distances brought about by changing trade routes as a result of production cuts in the Middle East Gulf OPEC members and the reduction in trade. One of the reasons for the increase in ton-miles for petroleum products may be that India and the Republic of Korea increased production, so the Middle East Gulf refineries had to develop markets in other consumer areas such as Europe and the United States. Consequently, average transportation distances for petroleum products increased. 33. In the dry bulk segment in 1999, iron ore decreased in volume for the second consecutive year. Accordingly, its transport performance declined by 3.7 per cent to 2,220 billion ton-miles. Coal and grain increased in volume by 4.2 per cent and 10.0 per cent respectively, pushing their shipping demand up to the highest level of 2,430 billion ton-miles and 1,170 billion ton-miles respectively. The shipping performance for the three main dry bulk commodities combined increased by 0.5 per cent to 5,820 billion ton-miles in 1999. In the category of other cargo, shipping performance also improved by 3.5 per cent to 6,150 billion ton-miles in 1999. The trade in containers is the most important commodity affecting the performance in ton-miles.

Chapter II STRUCTURE AND OWNERSHIP OF THE WORLD FLEET This chapter reviews the supply-side dynamics of the world maritime industry. The information and data provided comprehensively cover the structure and ownership of the world fleet. The chapter also reviews deliveries and demolition of vessels, tonnage on order and markets for second-hand tonnage. A. STRUCTURE OF THE WORLD FLEET World containership fleet Principal types of vessel fleet 34. Comparative time-series data on the world fleet for 1997, 1998 and 1999 are provided in table 6 and amounted graph 4. The world merchant to 799.0 million deadweight tons (dwt) at the end of 1999. This represents a 1.3 per cent increase over 1998, when the world fleet had expanded at a rate of 1.6 per cent from the tonnage in 1997. The relatively low rate of fleet expansion was attributable primarily to an increase to 30.7 million dwt of tonnage broken up and lost, while the newbuilding deliveries increased slightly to 40.5 million dwt, leaving a net gain of 9.8 million dwt in 1999 as compared with a net gain of 12.0 million dwt in 1998. The tonnage of oil tankers and dry bulk carriers 35. continued to increase in 1999 by 1.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively, representing 70.0 per cent of total tonnage in 1999, a slight decline from 70.3 per cent in the previous year. The fleet of general cargo ships increased in 1999 slightly by 0.2 per cent representing 12.7 per cent of the world total fleet. Containerships in terms of deadweight tonnage increased by 2.5 million dwt or 4.1 per cent, which now represented 7.9 per cent of the world total fleet. This relatively high rate of increase reflected the growing portion of manufactured goods being traded which are generally moving in containers. Tonnage of liquid gas carriers (mainly LNG and LPG carriers) and ferries/passenger ships have been steadily increasing in absolute terms (deadweight tonnage). of by the end fully The world 4,298,000 TEUs reaching 2,433 ships with a cellular fleet 36. containerships continued to expand substantially in 1999 in terms of both number of ships and their TEU capacity, total of capacity of 1999, representing an increase of 2.9 per cent in the number of ships and 5.8 per cent in TEU capacity over the previous year (see table 7). Ship sizes also continued to increase with average carrying capacity per ship growing from 1,717 TEUs in 1998 to 1,766 TEUs in 1999, reflecting economies of scale for reduction in operating costs. At the end of 1999, 98 post-Panamax ships with an aggregated capacity of 523,500 TEUs were in service (average carrying capacity 5,342 TEUs), representing 4.1 per cent of the number of ships and 12.4 per cent of the TEU capacity of the world containership fleet. This development will continue, judging by the upward trend of post-Panamax newbuilding orders. Towards the end of 1999, the newbuilding orders for all sizes stood at 247 ships, with a total capacity of 803,000 TEUs, which were scheduled to enter into service over the next couple of years. Within these newbuildings, 56 ships with a total capacity of 324,700 TEUs were post-Panamax size, accounting for 22.7 per cent of the number of ships and 40.4 per cent in the capacity of the world order book. 37. The world containership fleet registered in major open-registry countries continued to expand in 1999 to 39.5 per cent of the world TEU capacity as compared to 38.1 per cent in 1998.

The average age of the total world fleet decreased in 1999 for the fourth consecutive year to 14.09 years from 14.54 years in 1998. By type of vessel, the average age of tankers fell rather significantly to 13.91 years in 1999 from the previous year's average of 15.00 years. The share of tanker tonnage aged 15 years and over decreased to 47.6 per cent in 1999 from 55.1 per cent in 1998, reflecting increased in 1999 which stood at scrapping activities 16.7 million dwt (7.4 million dwt in 1998). The average age of the dry bulk carrier fleet rose slightly to 13.83 years. Containerships continued to be the youngest fleet in 1999, with a decrease in average age to 9.72 years from 10.99 years in 1998. This is explained by level of newbuilding activities continued to lower the average age of containerships. This trend is also reflected in the share of tonnage between 0 and 4 years of age, which continued to increase in 1999 to 36.1 per cent from 33.9 per cent in 1998. the high the fact that

For the 15-years-and-over age group, the mid-point has been assumed to be 22 years.

By country grouping, the major open-registry 39. countries continued to have the lowest average age of all ships (13.67 years in 1999 versus 14.30 years in 1998), as a growing tendency to register newbuildings under open-registry flags was observed. The group's share of tonnage between 0 and 4 years of age increased in 1999 to 20.3 per cent from 19.1 per cent in 1998. On the other hand, their share of tonnage of 15 years and over decreased in 1999 to 47.1 per cent from 50.7 per cent in 1998. Developed market-economy countries also reduced the average age of their fleet to 13.75 years in 1999 compared to 14.41years in 1998. In this group, the average age of containerships was 9.16 years in 1999 as compared with 10.24 years in 1998. The share of ships aged between 0 and 4 years increased to 40.8 per cent in 1999 from 37.9 per cent in 1998. The average age of all ships registered in developing countries (excluding major open-registry countries) decreased slightly in 1999 to 14.19 years as compared with 14.40 years in 1998. This improved group's substantially to 9.13 years in 1999 from 11.39 years in 1998, reflecting the high share of 39.9 per cent of ships between 0 and 4 years of age. The average age of tonnage registered in the socialist countries of Asia continued to increase to 18.05 years in 1999 from 17.58 years in 1998. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe continued to have the oldest fleet (19.01 years in 1999 versus 18.04 years in 1998) with vessels built more than 15 years ago representing 75.8 per cent of their total fleet (67.7 per cent in 1998). containerships' average age Delivery of newbuildings 40. Newbuilding activities attained the highest level ever recorded in terms of deadweight tons with deliveries amounting to 40.5 million dwt in 1999 (see table 9). However, the total number of vessels delivered decreased to 940 units from 1,041 units in 1998. Thus the average size of tonnage increased to 43,000 dwt from 34,000 dwt in the previous year. This high level of delivery continued to be sustained primarily by tanker deliveries of 19.1 million dwt, which was up 51.1 per cent from the 1998 level. Another features was that more of the larger tankers were delivered in 1999 than in the previous year, with an average deadweight tonnage of 119,000 in 1999 compared to 105,000 in 1998. A similar trend was observed in the dry bulk carriers sector. The number of newbuildings decreased to 191 units in 1999 from 217 units in 1998, while total tonnage expanded to 12.6 million dwt from 11.6 million dwt, with the average deadweight tons per vessel increasing to 66,000 from 53,000 in 1998. Newbuildings for other types of vessels including general cargo ships and containerships as a whole shrank both in number and in deadweight tonnage to 585 units of 8.4 million dwt from 704 units of 11.1 million dwt in 1998. Demolition of ships 41. Trends in tonnage, types and average age of broken-up vessels are shown in tables 10, 11 and 12. In 1999, total tonnage sold for demolition continued to increase substantially by 21.8 per cent from the tonnage of the previous year to 30.7 million dwt, which accounted for 3.9 per cent of the world total deadweight tons, as compared to 3.2 per cent in 1998. Sales of tankers for breaking up increased significantly by 124.3 per cent to 16.7 million dwt, which was more than double the 7.4 million dwt broken up in 1998. These sales were strongly influenced by the increasing pressure from law- enforcing governmental agents and environmental groups, coupled with the availability of newbuildings. ULCC/VLCC sales doubled from 16 units in 1998 to 35 units in 1999. Suezmaxes also doubled from 13 units in 1998 to 26 units in 1999, while Aframaxes actually tripled from 10 units in 1998 to 30 units in 1999. In the smaller category of crude oil tankers, 21 ships were sold for scrap in 1999, as compared to 13 units in the previous year. Due to the increased scrapping activity, the average age of tankers sold for demolition was significantly down from 28.2 years in 1998 to 26.2 years in 1999. Dry bulk carriers sold for scrap amounted to only 9.7 million dwt in 1999, down from 12.8 million dwt in 1998. Most of this reduction was accounted for by the reduction in the scrapping of larger size bulk carriers. Capesize units decreased to 19 in 1999 from 28 in 1998 while Panamax size showed less reduction, from 60 units in 1998 to 56 units in 1999. Sales of handy-size dry bulkers were down to 135 units in 1999 from 178 in the previous year. The average age of all dry bulk carriers broken up was 25.0 years in 1999. Other ship types also have a similar trading life with containerships being sold to breakers with an average age of 24.8 years and general cargo ships with an average age of 26.7 years in 1999.

B. OWNERSHIP OF THE WORLD FLEET Distribution of world tonnage by country groups 42. The total world fleet continued to expand in 1999 by 1.3 per cent to 799 million dwt (see table 13 and graph 5). Tonnage of developed market-economy countries increased marginally by 0.6 million dwt to 203.2 million dwt. Major open-registry countries in 1999 expanded their tonnage substantially by 7.9 million dwt or 2.1 per cent to a record high of 384.7 million dwt. Approximately two-thirds of these beneficially-owned fleets are owned by developed market-economy countries and the rest by developing countries. The share owned by developing countries has continued to increase. Tonnage registered in developing countries in 1999 increased substantially by 2.8 million dwt or1.9 per cent to 153.6 million dwt. This increase resulted from the investments made by shipowners in Asian developing countries, whose fleets expanded by 3.7 million dwt or 3.4 per cent to 112.2 million dwt, accounting for 73 per cent of the developing countries' total fleet. The fleets for other groups of developing countries were marginally reduced in 1999. The fleet of developing countries of America decreased by 0.6 million dwt to 33.9 million dwt, while that of African developing countries also decreased, by 0.2 million dwt to 6.1 million dwt. The shares of the socialist countries of Asia and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in total world tonnage also continued to decrease in 1999 to 3.2 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively.

Table 14 provides more detailed data on fleet distribution by types of vessel and country groups for 1980, 1998 and 1999. In the oil tanker sector, the share of developed market-economy countries stopped its continuous decrease, but increased only marginally to 30.5 per cent in 1999 from 29.8 per cent in 1998. Conversely, the open-registry countries' share decreased slightly to 50.2 per cent, as compared to 51.2 per cent in the previous year. These very small fluctuations in both country groups still reflect the continuous trend, specifically for owners in developed market-economy countries, to prefer to register registry. Developing countries continued in 1999 to increase their share from 15.9 per cent to 16.2 per cent; this represented continuously particular increasing share of Asian developing countries, which expanded in 1999 to 12.9 per cent of the world tanker fleet. tonnage under open tanker the in 44. In the dry bulk carrier sector, the tonnage share of developed market-economy countries in the world total continued to decrease to 17.0 per cent in 1999, which stood at one third of the share in 1980 (52.7 per cent). Major open-registry countries continuously expanded their share, amounting to 54.9 per cent in 1999, as compared to 53.5 per cent in 1998. The developing countries' share remained flat the share of in 1999 at 20.1 per cent, while developing countries of Asia in 1999 was also at virtually the same level (15.7 per cent) as in the previous year (15.6 per cent). Dry bulk carriers represent the most important fleet of developing countries with a share of nearly 36 per cent in 1999 (37 per cent in 1998) of the total tonnage owned and registered in this group (see annex IIIb). The fleet developments, in the sector of general cargo ships, of the three major country groups, including developing Asia, were very similar to that of the dry bulk carrier sector. Nevertheless, the developing countries' share in the general cargo ship sector, represents 26.5 per cent, which is the highest in this country group's share in the five principal types of vessel. The world containership fleet remained at 45. 8 per cent of the world total deadweight tons in 1999. Developed market-economy countries decreased their share of containership deadweight tonnage to 34.6 per cent in 1999. On the other hand, the major open- registry countries' share continued to expand, reaching 39.8 per cent in that year, approximately two-thirds of which represented containerships beneficially owned by owners in developed market- economy countries. The share of developing countries increased very slightly to 18.8 per cent, of which 13.6 per cent was shared by Asian developing countries.

The structure of the fleet of main country groups 46. Table 15 provides data on the structure of the merchant fleet of the main country groups as at 1 January 2000. Developed market-economy countries' tonnage in tankers increased in 1999 by 3.1 million dwt to 42.6 per cent of the group's total fleet from 41.2 per cent in the previous year. Their dry bulk carriers decreased by 2.9 million dwt to 23.1 per cent from 24.6 per cent in 1998. Their general cargo ships and containerships shrank slightly to 9.8 per cent and 10.8 per cent respectively as compared to 10.0 per cent and 11.2 per cent in 1998. Major open-registry countries increased their total fleets substantially by 7.8 million dwt. A greater proportion of their fleets was in the oil tanker and dry bulk carrier sectors, with both ship types accounting for 76.4 per cent of their fleet in 1999. Their oil tankers decreased in 1999 by 1.3 million dwt to 37.0 per cent of the group's total fleet from 38.1 per cent in 1998 whilst the dry bulk carriers increased in 1999 by 4.2 million dwt to 39.4 per cent as compared to 39.1 per cent in the previous year. Their general cargo ships increased in 1999 by 0.8 million dwt, accounting for 10.2 per cent of remained fleet, total the group's unchanged from their Their 1998 containership fleet expanded in 1999 by 1.7 million dwt to 6.6 per cent of their total fleet from 6.3 per cent in 1998. which proportion. 47. In developing countries, tonnage distribution is characterized by a comparatively high proportion of dry bulk carriers and oil tankers, representing 36.1 per cent and 29.9 per cent respectively in 1999. In absolute terms, their 1999 tonnage in dry bulk carriers and oil tankers stood at 55.5 million dwt and 46.0 million dwt as compared to 47.0 million dwt and 86.6 million dwt for developed market-economy countries. The share of general cargoships in this group remained stable in 1999 at 27.5 million dwt compared to 27.6 million dwt in 1998, while containerships increased significantly by 1.4 million dwt to 7.8 per cent in 1999 from 7.0 per cent in the previous year. In the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, general cargo ships are relatively dominant, accounting for 37.7 per cent in 1999, as compared to 36.1 per cent in 1998. On the other hand, containerships have remained unchanged at 0.4 million dwt, representing around 2 per cent since the early 1990s. The socialist countries of Asia continued to have a predominant share of both dry bulk carriers and general cargo ships. However the absolute tonnage and proportion of these types of vessel decreased in 1999 to 11.3 million dwt (from 11.7 million dwt in 1998) or 43.8 per cent (45.0 per cent in 1998) for dry bulk carriers, and 7.8 million dwt (7.9 million dwt in 1998) or 30.2 per cent (30.4 per cent in 1998) for general cargo ships. Conversely, the absolute tonnage of containerships increased by 0.1 million dwt in 1999 to 1.7 million dwt or 6.6 per cent (6.2 per cent in 1998). C. REGISTRY OF VESSELS The 35 most important maritime countries and territories 48. The ranking in terms of deadweight for the 35 most important maritime countries and territories is provided in table 16. In 1999, these 35 countries and territories controlled 94.2 per cent of the world merchant fleet (94.0 per cent in 1998). Finland, which was listed 31st and the United Arab Emirates 35th in 1998, were replaced by Monaco and Thailand in 1999. With a total tonnage of 3.0 million dwt and 2.8 million dwt, each represented 0.4 per cent of the world total fleet. The five largest countries controlled 50.7 per cent (50.0 per cent in 1998) and the top 10 countries controlled 67.7 per cent (67.3 per cent in 1998) of the world total fleet. 49. It is notable that among these countries and territories the trend to register under a foreign flag continued in 1999. The total tonnage registered under foreign flags in 1999 increased to 431.2 million dwt representing 62.5 per cent of the 35 countries' total fleet, as compared with 421.2 million dwt or 61.8 per cent in 1998. It is a recent trend that developing countries and territories have continued to register their tonnage under foreign flags. In 1999, the 11 developing countries and territories listed in the table (including Hong Kong (China), but excluding Taiwan Province of China) had more than half their total tonnage registered under foreign flags representing 52.9 per cent (52.2 per cent in 1998). In spite of the continuous trend for flagging out by developing countries, there are significant differences among these countries. The foreign registry of Saudi Arabia and Hong Kong (China) amounted to 91.8 per cent and 79.2 per cent respectively, while the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Philippines and Kuwait made significantly less use of the benefits of foreign flag facilities, which represented 1.3, 10.5 and 9.4 per cent respectively of their fleets. For developed market-economy countries, the share of foreign-registred tonnage slightly increased to 67.5 per cent in 1999 from 67.2 per cent in 1998.

29 Major open registries The share of the world merchant fleet in 50. foreign registers continued to expand but to a lesser extent in 1999 than in the previous year. Tonnage distribution of the seven major open-registry countries by principal types of vessel is shown in table 17. The total tonnage registered in 1999 increased moderately by 2.2 per cent to 362.1 million dwt from 354.1 million dwt in the previous year, which had expanded significantly by 7.7 per cent. Panama continued to lead the list, enlarging its fleet in 1999 by 4.2 million dwt or 3.0 per cent. Liberia had the second largest increase with its fleet growing marginally by 1.7 per cent. The combined tonnage of these two countries amounts to one third of the total tonnage of the seven major open-registry countries. In 1999, Malta increased its fleet substantially by 7.0 per cent to 40.3 million dwt while Cyprus and the Bahamas reduced their tonnage by 2.3 per cent and 0.4 per cent to 32.7 million dwt and 39.8 million dwt respectively. The analysis by type of vessel indicated that dry bulk stood at 39.4 per cent of the total deadweight in 1999 as compared with 39.2 per cent in 1998, followed by oil tankers, which cut back their share to 37.6 per cent in 1999 from 38.6 per cent in the previous year. Combined tonnage of these two types of vessels accounts for 77.0 per cent of the total deadweight. General cargo ships (3,333 ships) accounted for 33.5 per cent of the total number of ships, reflecting the trend of the maritime industry to flag out in this sector, followed by dry bulk carriers of 2,678 ships or 26.9 per cent of the total. Nationality of vessels Table 18 51. the participation of nationals in the registry of the most important open or indicates international registers. The data compare the total tonnage registered in selected countries of registry with the tonnage owned by the nationals of, and registered in, the countries of registry. The share of tonnage owned by nationals of open-registry countries is minimal or zero, while ownership of nationals of the two international registries was nearly 85 and 100 per cent. These two countries (Norway and Denmark) were ranked third and twelfth of the 35 most important maritime countries in 1999. in total 92.1 per open-registry the control 10 largest countries of 78.1 per cent 52.

33 D. SHIPBUILDING AND THE SECOND- HAND MARKET Newbuilding orders 53. In 1999, newbuilding contracts for six major ship types, aggregating 49.6 million dwt, were placed, increasing by 16.9 per cent in comparison with the contracts in 1998 (see table 20). In the tanker sector, deteriorating world trade in crude oil in 1999 further pressured the freight level in overall tanker markets, particularly in the middle-larger crude oil tankers. Owners and speculators who expected uncertain near- future tanker markets were reluctant to place new orders for tanker tonnage, although newbuilding prices were at a significantly low level. Eventually, 206 units aggregating 16.8 million dwt were ordered in 1999, as compared with 280 units totalling 21.9 million dwt in 1998. The 1999 newbuilding orders for dry bulk carriers more than doubled the record of the previous year to 346 units of 23.9 million dwt, concentrating on the last quarter of the year. This reflects the fact that in 1999 the dry bulk supply and demand balance improved, in particular as the growth in demand was remarkably higher during the second half of 1999 than in the first six months. 54. Newbuilding orders for containerships continued to rise substantially by 20 per cent to 170 units totalling 7.2 million dwt in 1999 as compared to 178 units of 6.0 million dwt. These newbuilding tonnages reflect the recent trend for the enlargement of ships such as post- Panamax containerships, which represented an average tonnage of 42,000 dwt in 1999 in comparison with 34,000 dwt in 1998. The newbuilding orders for general cargo ships declined signficiantly in 1999 to 162 units of 1.3 million dwt from 333 units totalling 2.5 million dwt in 1998. On the other hand, the orders for passenger ferries were flat as regards the number of vessels, but increased substantially to a total of 348,000 dwt in 1999 from 231,000 dwt in the previous year, also reflecting the existence of larger vessels in 1999 (average 3,000 dwt) than in 1998 (average of 2,000 dwt). Tonnage on order 55. World tonnage on order, by groups of countries of registry and by principal types of vessel are shown in table 21. World tonnage on order at the end of 1999 stood at 83.5 million dwt, representing a marginal increase of 1.6 per cent over the previous year. Tonnage on order by developed market-economy countries amounted to 26.6 million dwt, accounting for 31.8 per cent of the world total tonnage on order, as compared with 25.5 million dwt or 31.0 per cent in 1998. Major open- registry countries had 41.4 million dwt or 49.5 per cent of world tonnage on order, as compared with 45.4 million dwt or 55.2 per cent in 1998. The share of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe continued to decrease in 1999, to 0.7 million dwt or 0.9 per cent of the world total on order, whilst the share of the socialist countries of Asia increased in 1999, ending the year with 2.1 million dwt or 2.5 per cent of the world total on order compared with 1.4 million dwt or 1.7 per cent in 1998. tonnage Developing increased countries' 56. significantly to 10.5 million dwt or 12.6 per cent of the world total tonnage on order at the end of 1999, as compared with 8.0 million dwt or 9.8 per cent in 1998. Tonnage on order by Asian developing countries increased substantially by 2.7 million dwt to 9.4 million dwt at the end of 1999, which accounted for 89.3 per cent of the developing countries' total tonnage on order. There was some growth in the African newbuilding orders, rising to 0.15 per cent of the world total on order at the end of 1999, as compared with only 0.01 per cent in 1998, while American developing countries reduced their share to 1.13 per cent of the world total on order in 1999 from 1.60 per cent in the previous year. In 1999, dry bulk carriers on order at the end of 57. the year increased substantially by 23.9 per cent to 24.5 million dwt accounting for 29.4 per cent of the world total on order. For this type of vessel, developed market- economy countries and major open-registry countries accounted for 19.4 per cent and 64.8 per cent, representing a combined share of more than 80 per cent. The volume of containerships on order also expanded in 1999 by 33.3 per cent to 10 million dwt at the year end, representing 11.9 per cent of the world total on order. For containerships on order, developed market-economy countries and major open-registry countries accounted for 40 per cent each. Developing countries' containership orders increased from 0.3 million dwt in 1998 to 1.0 million dwt in 1999, which accounted for 10 per cent of the total. Asian developing countries had 0.9 million dwt or 87.5 per cent of the developing countries' total on order. Oil tanker orders declined in 1999 by 10.4 per cent to 37.0 million dwt, accounting for 44.2 per cent of the world total on order. Developing countries had 6.9 million dwt on order, representing 18.7 per cent of the total, of which Asian developing countries increased by 53.0 per cent to 6.5 million dwt or 94.4 per cent of the developing countries' total.

Prices of newbuildings and second-hand tonnage Table 22 indicates newbuilding prices for the 58. main types of vessel. In 1999, prices for all the main types and sizes of newbuildings continued to decline significantly below those of the previous year, although total newbuilding contracts in 1999 expanded by nearly 10 million dwt from the level of the previous year. The downward pressure on prices in 1999 continue to be mainly due to the increasing competitiveness of Asian shipyards. The Republic of Korea and Japan have been dominating the world shipbuilding market, while China recently expanded its building capacity, securing a substantial increase in its order book in 1999. Korean shipyards have become the most competitive in the world, mainly due to the rapid enhancement of their productivity and technology coupled with the depreciation of the currency. Japanese shipyards have endeavoured to overcome unfavourable exchange rates, and strong dry bulk carrier demand in 1999 helped them to secure new orders. Nevertheless major shipyards in Japan have still been under pressure to become more competitive in the world shipbuilding market. Analysis by vessel type shows that oil tanker newbuilding prices for all sizes declined by 10 to 14 per cent in 1999 from their 1998 level. Newbuilding prices for all dry bulk carriers also fell significantly in 1999 by 8 to 21 per cent from the previous year's level, varying substantially in accordance with the size of the bulkers. However, the volume contracted in 1999 increased dramatically by nearly 90 per cent over the order book of the previous year. Prices of 2,500 TEU cellular containerships and 125,000 m3 LNG vessels declined by 16.7 per cent and 14.9 per cent respectively in 1999. The downward trend of shipbuilding prices thus continued for all types and sizes of vessel. About 120 oil tankers 59. (over 10,000 dwt) changed hands in 1999, compared with approximately 90 ships in 1998. In 1999, quality modern tonnage offered for sale remained limited for most of the year.

37 early 1990s stayed firm at unchanged levels in 1999. Late 1980s-built Suezmax tonnage fell around 10 per cent from the 1998 level, whilst double-hull units built in the early to middle 1990s were subject to marginal price adjustments. In the case of dry bulk carriers, nearly 350 units between 20,000 and 250,000 dwt were sold in 1999. During the first half of that year, a relatively large number of 1980s-built dry bulkers of over 100,000 dwt were circulated in the market for sale. After August, most of these large units, mainly Capesize tonnages, were employed in charter markets, and thus fewer ships of this size were available in the sale and purchase market. Throughout the year, the price for dry bulk carriers increased by 15-20 per cent over its level in 1998, specifically for modern tonnages. Interest in buying Panamaxes accelerated in 1999 with about 100 ships sold, doubling the number of sales in 1998. Owing to a relatively firm chartering market in the last six months, the majority of the Panamaxes purchased were 1980s- built units. Thus, quality early 1990s-built tonnages changed hands at price levels more than 15 per cent higher than in 1998. In the segment of 20-50,000 dwt dry bulkers, more than 220 units were sold in 1999. Greek buyers again dominated the market for second-hand dry bulk tonnage. Most of them were interested in 1980s- built Handymaxes. They also contributed to an increase in prices, specifically for early-middle 1990s-built tonnages, which became nearly 20 per cent higher than in the previous year.

Chapter III PRODUCTIVITY OF THE WORLD FLEET AND SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN WORLD SHIPPING This chapter provides information on the operational productivity of the world fleet and an analysis of the balance between supply and demand for tonnage. Key indicators are the comparison of cargo generation and fleet ownership, tons of cargo carried and ton-miles performed per dwt, and the analysis of tonnage oversupply in the main shipping market sectors. A. OPERATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY Estimate of tons and ton-miles per dwt 60. The main indicators of operational productivity for the world fleet are shown in table 24 and graph 6. Tons of cargo carried per deadweight ton (dwt) in 1999 maintained the same level as in the previous year at 6.42, which had been a new record high, whilst ton-miles performed per deadweight ton fell substantially to 26,884. This represents the lowest operational productivity below thus 27,000 since 1993, when continuing a downward movement it fell to 26,730, already observed in 1998. The deterioration in ton- miles per dwt was a reflection of the continuing changes in trade structures, particularly in the crude oil trades and some major dry bulk trades such as iron ore In (see chapter I, International Seaborne Trade). 1999, some positive developments the such as enlargement of consignment and vessel sizes, improved port conditions and only marginal growth (1.3 per cent) in vessel supply, were offset by decreasing growth in total demand (to 1.3 per cent from 2.2 per cent in 1998) resulting in stagnating volumes per dwt and lower operational productivity in terms of ton-miles.

Indicative data on ton-miles performed by oil tankers, dry bulk carriers, combined carriers and the residual fleet are provided in table 25. Ton-miles per deadweight ton of oil tankers continued to decrease in 1999 by 4.6 per cent as compared with 1998, while ton-miles per deadweight ton of dry bulk carriers, combined carriers and the residual fleet increased by 0.7, 3.6 and 1.4 per cent, respectively, The continuously over deteriorating performance by oil is attributable mainly to changing regional structures of crude oil trades, which have consequently resulted in less ton-mile performance on the part of the whole oil tanker sector. Imbalance between supply and demand is another factor. The total carrying capacity of oil tankers increased by 1.0 per cent in 1999 while the growth of crude oil and oil products decreased by 1.0 per cent. Dry bulkers' ton-miles per deadweight ton increased nearly 1.0 per cent in 1999, clearly the contrasting the negative B8.3 per cent the downward previous year and halting trend prevailing since 1994. In 1999 total dry bulk cargo increased by 3.0 per cent as compared with its volume in 1998, while carrying capacity in is performance of dry bulkers remained flat with no particular increase. Nevertheless, still considerably below the maximum of over 19,000 ton- miles/dwt observed in 1993/1994. Performance of combined carriers continued to increase as in previous years, reaching 46,500 ton-miles per dwt. The relevance of these data is, however, somewhat reduced by the decreasing size and importance of this type of tonnage that is mainly deployed in oil trades. Total ton-miles performed stand at only 10 per cent of the total for oil tankers. 62. Table 26 provides supplementary data on operational productivity in terms of cargo carried per deadweight ton. Cargo volumes in tons carried per deadweight ton of oil tankers continued to decrease by 3.9 per cent in 1999 over the previous year. Those cargo volumes carried per deadweight ton of dry bulk carriers, combined carriers and the residual fleet increased by 1.3, 3.4 and 1.9 per cent respectively compared with those in 1998. This analysis indicates that the same trends as those in terms of ton-miles per deadweight ton prevailed in 1999.

43 The supply and demand mechanism by type of vessel Tonnage supply in the oil tanker sector decreased 63. substantially in 1999 by 9.2 million dwt to 281.8 million dwt. This indicates that oil tanker newbuildings delivered in 1999 stood at 6.5 million dwt while deleted tonnage reached nearly 16 million dwt. As a result overcapacity was reduced to 14.0 million dwt or 5.0 per cent of the total world tanker fleet, while seaborne trade for oil tankers declined by 1.0 per cent in 1999 compared with the previous year (see table 27 and graph 7). In 1999, nearly 1.0 million dwt of dry bulker newbuildings were delivered while tonnages of nearly 12.5 million dwt were deleted from shipping industries. Thus the total dry bulk fleet supply was reduced substantially by 11.4 million dwt. On the other hand, main dry bulk commodities increased by 2.8 per cent in 1999 over the previous year. Despite some favourable factors, overcapacity in the dry bulk sector increased significantly in 1999 to 7.9 million dwt, representing an increase of 2.1 million dwt and accounting for 3.2 per cent of the world dry bulk fleet. In actual fact the tonnage deleted in 1999 decreased by approximately 25 per cent over the previous year's figure. This means that further deletion of aged uneconomical dry bulkers should be promoted in order to bring the supply and demand mechanism into better balance. In the sector of the general cargo fleet, overcapacity remained relatively stable in 1999 with supply capacity exceeding demand by 1.8 million dwt or 3.0 per cent for the world fleet of this sector. The surplus tonnage of general cargo vessels has followed a downward trend since the early 1990s. In the unitized fleet sector, 3.0 million dwt of containership newbuildings were delivered in 1999, topping up the 8 million dwt tonnage delivered in the previous year. Although newbuildings of this sector have been increasing, liner shipping industry markets have been able in full to absorb employment of the world unitized fleet. thus resulting tonnages, these Table 27 Analysis of tonnage oversupply by main type of vessel, 1992-1999 a (average yearly figures in millions of dwt) Supply of world tanker fleet Total tanker fleet surplus b Share of surplus fleet in the world tanker fleet (per cent) Supply of world dry bulk fleet Dry bulk fleet surplus b Share of surplus in the world dry bulk fleet (per cent) Supply of world conventional general cargo fleet Conventional general cargo fleet surplus Share of surplus in the world conventional general cargo fleet (per cent) Supply of world unitized fleet c Surplus of unitized fleet Share of surplus in the world unitized fleet (per cent) 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 283.4 284.6 282.9 277.0 285.1 290.6 291.0 281.8 41.8 43.5 39.0 28.8 28.8 17.0 17.3 14.0 14.7 237.3 15.3 238.6 13.8 242.6 10.4 252.9 10.1 257.2 5.8 260.9 5.9 257.1 5.0 245.7 25.1 23.6 20.3 17.9 17.2 10.3 5.8 7.9 10.6 63.0 2.7 9.9 62.1 2.8 8.4 61.9 2.2 7.1 62.0 2.0 6.7 62.7 1.4 3.9 62.0 1.7 2.3 60.5 1.6 3.2 59.9 1.8 4.3 4.5 3.6 3.2 2.2 2.7 2.6 3.0 43.0 45.7 49.8 53.4 59.3 65.7 73.1 76.1 0.7 0.7 0.5 0.7 0 0 0 0 1.6 1.5 1.0 1.3 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Source: UNCTAD secretariat on the basis of data from Lloyd's Shipping Economist (London), various issues. a Aggregates for all sectors shown in this table are averages for the years indicated and therefore differ from the world figures in table 28.

B. SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN WORLD SHIPPING Surplus tonnage 64. An indicative summary of the balance of tonnage supply and demand for the 1992-1999 period is provided in table 28. The total surplus tonnage in 1999 continued to decrease by 1.0 million dwt to a new record of 23.7 million dwt or 3.0 per cent of the world merchant fleet from 3.1 per cent in 1998. This improved balance was largely attributable to the continuously increasing trade volume, specifically since 1997, which reached nearly 5.0 billion tons, when surplus tonnage was halved to 3.7 per cent as compared to the level of 6.4 to 10.3 per cent for the previous years (1991-1996). In 1999, growth of tonnage supply and demand was evenly balanced. COMPARISON OF CARGO C. TURNOVER AND FLEET OWNERSHIP 65. The correlation between cargo volume generated by different country groups and their fleet ownership is summarized in table 29. Developed market-economy countries generated nearly 55 cent of world seaborne trade in 1999 compared with about 54 per cent in 1980. The tonnage share of developed market-economy countries has been significantly reduced from nearly 80 per cent in 1980 to 57 per cent in 1999. Their ownership either under national flag (25 per cent of the world total in 1999) or foreign flags (32 per cent of the world total in 1999) is maintained to support their trade position. The share of developing countries in world cargo turnover has remained at a level of slightly less than 40 per cent. Their tonnage owned under national flags had increased from 10 per cent of the world fleet in the 1980s to nearly 20 per cent in the 1990s, while beneficially owned tonnage has expanded to nearly one third of the total beneficially-registered tonnage or 16 per cent of the world fleet as owners in developing countries have also been resorting to open-registry facilities. The share of world cargo turnover generated by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe remained at 3.4 per cent in 1999, unchanged from the 1998 level, but significantly less than 4.7 per cent in 1980. Their fleet position also declined from 5.5 per cent to 2.3 per cent in 1999. The countries socialist Asia of

45 increased their share in world trade to 2.8 per cent in 1999, while they improved their share in world tonnage from 1.6 per cent in 1980 to 3.2 per cent in 1999. The short-term analysis indicates a different aspect in that these countries increased their share in world trade from 2.2 per cent in 1996 to 2.8 per cent in 1999, while their share of national flags in world tonnage decreased from 3.8 per cent in 1996 to 3.2 per cent in 1999. On the other hand, China increased its tonnage under foreign flags to 43.5 per cent of its total fleet in 1999 from 36.12 per cent in 1996.

Information on fleet ownership of 66. the major trading nations is provided in table 30. It may be noted that the major trading nations are also major owners of tonnage. This reflects an aspect of trade-supporting policies for exploiting maritime transport as a trade complement. It is generally considered that maritime capabilities, specifically the ownership of substantial tonnage, are essential for the country's trade support and promotion. The table also shows many similarities as well as differences in the shipping services of the leading trading nations. Major trading countries such as Japan, China (including Hong Kong), Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden and Norway are outstanding among the nations with maritime services for cross trades. Other major trading nations are major importers or users of shipping services, while they maintain a relevant ownership position and, to a lesser extent, national flag position. The United States, France and Canada come into this group. In 1999 the United States generated more than 15.3 per cent of world trade while it owned 6.7 per cent of world tonnage with only 1.6 per cent of such tonnage flying the national flag. Similarly, France and Canada generated 5.1 and 4.0 per cent respectively of world trade as compared to a tonnage ownership position of 0.7 and 0.4 per cent, and a national flag share of 0.3 and 0.1 per cent respectively.

Chapter IV TRADE AND FREIGHT MARKETS This chapter describes the conditions and trends in trade and freight markets, covering the major liner and bulk cargo sectors, gives liner freight rates as a percentage of commodity prices and estimates freight payments and freight costs as a percentage of import value in world trade . A. LINER SHIPPING MARKET (a) Developments in liner markets General developments fleets with their containership 67. Total world liner shipments of containerized cargo in 1999 have reached approximately 50 million TEUs, with forecasts for up to 53 million TEUs in 2000. With trade prospects buoyant, major liner operators are upgrading larger containerships such as post-Panamax on East-West trunk liner routes. The world fleet of fully cellcular containerships continued to expand substantially in 1999 in terms of both number of ships and their TEU capacity, total capacity of reaching 2,433 ships with a 4,298,000 TEUs by the end of 1999, representing an increase of 2.9 per cent in the number of ships and 5.8 per cent in TEU capacity over the previous year. Groupings of liner operators The processes of competitive positioning of liner 68. operating companies, the majority of which were made during the three-year period (1997B1999), led eventually to the emergence of new mega-carriers. Table 31 gives the latest profile of the supply-side dynamics of container shipping through concentration processes. The top 10 companies' total carrying capacity at the beginning of 2000 increased by 11 per cent from that of the previous year, accounting for 51 per cent of the world total capacity. Similarly the top 20s increased by 9 per cent, sharing 69 per cent of the world total. The need to respond transport requirements and to rationalize the use of existing assets and new investments led major carriers to enter into groupings or "alliances" in the endeavour to reduce operation costs and promote their marketing strength by increasing global rapidly to through integrating service structures tie-ups or groupings. Under strategic programmes of major carriers, carrying capacity of the containerships in service on the East-West trunk routes continued to increase. At the beginning of 2000, 98 post-Panamax ships with an average carrying capacity of 5,300 TEUs per ship, were in service on the main East-West liner routes. At the end of 1999, 56 post-Panamax ships with a total capacity of 325,000 TEUs were on order. Given the delivery of these large newbuildings in the next couple of years, total carrying capacity of post-Panamaxes will be nearly 850,000 TEU. Table 32 provides estimated carrying capacity of "alliances" on the three major liner trades (Asia/North America, Asia/Europe-Mediterranean and North America/Europe-Mediterranean). At the beginning of 2000, all the alliances' carrying capacity reached 2.17 million TEUs, which accounted for approximately 45 per cent of the world total containerships' carrying capacity. Other liner operators, particularly mid-sized companies, still have to make the necessary decisions on their future competitive positioning, either as a global operator or as more of a niche carrier. Containership market developments 69. Global liner shipping market developments are best reflected in movements of the containership charter market. This market is largely dominated by German owners, and more particularly by members of the Association of Hamburg Brokers and Agents, who control about 75 per cent of freely available containership charter tonnage. Since 1998, the association publishes the "Hamburg Index" providing for a market analysis of containership time charter rates. Rates on 14-ton slot (TEU) per day are published on a monthly basis for three gearless and six geared size groups and compared to those obtained on average in

The development of time charter rates is reflected in table 33. In terms of TEU capacity, the world containership fleet continued to expand by 14, 18 and 12 per cent in 1996, 1997 and 1998 respectively until 1999 when growth slowed to 6 per cent. On the other hand, the Asian economic and financial crisis since 1997 hit not only the liner shipping trades between Asia and its major trading patners, but equally those among intra-regional countries. Charter rates drifted in the doldrums towards the end of 1998 and further into 1999. During the first half of 1999 charter rates remained depressed. This particularly related to size groups typically engaged in intercontinental or intra- Asian trades. Smaller tonnage, both geared and gearless, took less of a dip with specific employment patterns helping to weather the storm. In summer 1999, when growth of world containership carrying capacity proved to be halved from that of 1998, and already been Asia's encouraging global and regional liner shipping trades, rates generally picked up, with particularly positive development in the segments of larger vessels, both geared and gearless. The positive mood prevailed through the second half of 1999 and extended well into the year 2000. In fact, rates for larger geared vessels nearly doubled between mid-1999 and mid-2000. recovery had economic

53 In June 2000, rates for 2000+ TEU gearless and 1000+ TEU geared vessels for the first time surpassed the average 1997 levels and thus terminated an extended period of depressed markets with rates not covering operating costs. At the same time, it was observed that longer period charters of up to two years gained momentum. It has to be noted though, that these positive developments were partly compensated by bunker cost increases reflecting general movements of oil prices. In June 2000 prices went up to about US$ 152/t from about US$ 87/t 12 months earlier. It can thus be estimated, that a 1600 TEU ship with a consumption of 53 t per day at sea incurred bunker cost of more than US$ 8000 per day as compared to US$ 4600 in June 1999. (b) Freight level of main liner services In the transpacific trades, during the 70. fourth quarter of 1999, eastbound rates per TEU fell by 1.0 per cent from those of the previous quarter, whilst the average annual revenue per TEU in 1999 increased by 34.1 per cent to $ 2,005 per TEU as compared with that in the previous year (see table 34). The United States Ocean Shipping Act 1998 was implemented in May 1999, and new carriers made inroads into the trade in 1999. In these conditions, the rates increased in 1999. That was attributable to strong growth in eastbound trades, which continued to be driven primarily by exports from the Republic of Korea, China and Thailand. In the westbound trade, the market in the fourth quarter of 1999 remained stagnant at the low level, with rates declining by another 10.0 per cent from the previous quarter or by 13.0 per cent lower than in the fourth quarter in 1998. The average annual rate per TEU in 1999 declined by as much as 18.1 per cent from its level in 1998. Cargo volume on this trade route remained sluggish (see tables 35 and 36). United States exports, such as waste paper, rags and resins, for example, were affected by increasing pressure from European suppliers of these cargoes. In 2000, the trades are expected to expand at a minimum of 5 per cent both eastbound and westbound. Estimated growth of tonnage supply vary from 5 per cent to 10 per cent, thus maintaining space utilization at about the same level as in 1999. Consequently, it is not expected that average east or westbound freight levels will change significantly in 2000. 71. In the Asia-Europe trades, during the second quarter of 1999, freight rates on both westbound and eastbound routes showed relatively stable trends with revenue per TEU edging up by 1.0 per cent in both directions. The Far Eastern Freight Conference was somewhat optimistic about the trade. Actually the various operating units such as the Eastbound Management Agreement, Asia Westbound Rate Agreement and Japan/Europe Freight Conference imposed a series of rate restoration measures in 1999. Continuous expansion of cargo movements in both directions during the third and fourth quarters in 1999 raised freight levels by 1.0 and 6.0 per cent respectively on the Europe to Asia route, and 2.8 and 3.0 per cent respectively on the Asia-Europe route. In 2000, with cargo movements strong and ship- tonnage supply in relatively better balance with cargo demand, higher freight rates than in 1999 are expected by carriers. 72. The transatlantic trade remained the most problematic liner market in 1999. Freight rates on the eastbound trade fell further by 6.4 per cent. Relatively unfavourable economic conditions in Europe continued to pressurize growth in containerized traffic volume in both directions of this trade (see tables 35 and 36). The average annual rates for 1999 fell significantly by 22.8 per cent in the United States to Europe trade and 11.7 per cent in the opposite direction as compared with those in 1998. Nevertheless, a strong United States dollar and a weakening Euro caused Europe's exports to the United States to grow rather strongly in the second half of 1999, consequently helping rates to move upwards during that period. In 2000, the two basic developments of 1999 will continue to prevail, i.e. continuous United States dollar strength will maintain directional imbalances, and the supply of ship tonnage will continue to exceed demand, thus further intensifying competition among carriers. (c) Supply and demand in respect of main liner services 73. In 1999 liner trades continued to suffer from overcapacity and structural imbalances, even though some signs of improvement could be observed in late 1999 and in 2000. In the trade between Asia and the United States (transpacific), average space utilization on both trade routes (eastbound and westbound) improved marginally. At the same time, however, the gap between supply and demand widened. Ships' annual total carrying capacity eastbound or westbound increased by 4 per cent in 1999, while eastbound cargo volume grew 11.9 per cent and the space utilization improved from 77.6 per cent in 1998 to 83.5 per cent. As westbound growth remained below capacity increase, utilization rates decreased to 48.2 per cent from 49.8 per cent in 1998. Based on preliminary

Note: European trades do not include the Mediterranean. data and information available, in 2000 similar developments of ships' carrying capacity and cargo movements on both routes are expected, with average space utilization on both of the routes remaining unchanged from those registered in 1999 (see table 36). while cargo availability will grow at 7.0 per cent for the eastbound and 5.1 per cent for the westbound trades, resulting in further improvements in average space utilization to 72.1 per cent. On the Europe-Asia trade routes, ships' annual 74. total carrying capacity increased by 4 per cent in 1999, while cargo volume increased by 5.2 per cent on the eastbound route (Europe to Asia) and by 13.2 per cent on the westbound (Asia to Europe) route. As a result, average capacity utilization on both trade routes improved to 71.5 per cent from 67.8 per cent in 1998, with increasing trade imbalancces making it difficult for shipowners both to attract eastbound cargoes and to resolve problems of empty repositioning. In 2000, capacity is expected to increase by about 5.0 per cent, On the transatlantic trade routes, the imbalance 75. between eastbound and westbound trades has been slightly less pronounced than in the Asian trades with average capacity utilization being considerably lower. In 1999, the average space utilization declined to 61.5 per cent from 62.7 per cent in the previous year. Even though carrying capacity increased by only 3 per cent in 1999, trade volume was even less, averaging about 1.0 per cent on each route. In 2000, cargo movements are expected to expand by about 5.0 per cent each on both routes, matching the capacity increase of about 5.0 per cent.

57 (d) Liner freight index Table 37 indicates the developments of liner 76. freight rates on cargoes loaded or discharged by liners at ports in the Antwerp/Hamburg range from 1997 to date. The overall 1999 liner freight index decreased by 3 points to an average level of 86 (1995-100), reflecting the market situation in both homebound and outbound trades. In the homebound trade, the average level in 1999 increased by 6 points as compared with that in the previous year, reaching the same index in 1997 (95). The average level for the first quarter of 1999 decreased to 89 from 91 for the same period in 1998. This drop reflects a significant plummet by 9.4 per cent in the liner freight rates in the United States-Europe trade for the first quarter of 1999 from the rates for the last quarter of 1998. Since then, the monthly average index in 1999 was higher than in 1998. This upward trend is mainly attributable to the continuous rise in freight rates in the AsiaBEurope liner business, representing an increase of 6.8 per cent over the year. Conversely, the average outbound index in 1999 fell significantly by 12 points from the average level in 1998. Specifically, the average index for the first quarter in 1999 decreased substantially by 30 points from the level for the same quarter in 1998. This decrease reflects primarily the remarkable fall in freight rates in the first quarter of 1999 by 11.3 per cent from the average freight rates for the last quarter in 1998 in the Europe-Asia trade, and the continuous decrease during the first half of 1999 in the Europe-United States trade. The upward trend in the liner frieght rates on both homebound and outbound trade routes in the last half of 1999 continued to the first quarter of 2000, representing over 100 each month, thus reflecting on the overall index for the same period in 2000.

58 (e) Liner freight rates as percentage of prices for selected commodities 77. Table 38 provides data on freight rates of liner services as a percentage of market prices for selected commodities and trade routes in certain years between 1970 and 1999. The ratio of liner freight rates to the prices of jute, rubber sheet and coconut oil continued to stand at a higher level, compared with the rates for other commodities. Freight rates for jute in 1999 increased by 17.3 per cent, while the f.o.b. price also rose by 6.6 per cent. The f.o.b. price for jute is much lower than that of other commodities. This explains the high freight ratio. The f.o.b. price for rubber sheet fell by 12.7 per cent in 1999 when the freight rates rose by 6.4 per cent, thus arriving at a freight ratio of 16.3 per cent. The high ratio of coconut oil is attributable primarily to greatly increased freight rates in 1999, which rose by 27.8 per cent, albeit the c.i.f. price also increased by 12.0 per cent. The ratio of coffee and cocoa beans from Brazil to Europe in 1999 stood at 2.8 per cent and 6.0 per cent respectively. The freight rates rose by 26.7 per cent and 40.7 per cent each while the c.i.f. price fell by 27.1 per cent and 32.1 per cent respectively. The high increase in freight rates and the decrease in c.i.f. prices for the commodities mentioned turned out to be the ratio of small percentage. This is because the absolute freight amount is very small compared with the c.i.f. price. Similar mechanisms of fluctuations in freight rates and c.i.f. prices are applicable to coffee from Colombia (both Atlantic and Pacific) and cocoa beans from Ghana, although in those cases both freight rates and c.i.f. prices in 1999 decreased substantially compared with their levels in the previous years.

59 B. DRY BULK SHIPPING MARKET (a) Dry bulk trade 78. In 1999, overall dry cargo shipments increased at the relatively higher rate of 3.0 per cent, reaching approximately 2,970 million tons, of which main dry bulk commodities stood at 1,233 million tons or 41.5 per cent of total dry bulk cargo shipments. World crude steel production in 1999 increased very marginally by 1.3 per cent to 787 million tons. Iron ore shipments declined slightly by 1.7 per cent to 410 million tons in 1999. Coking coal also decreased marginally by 1.7 per cent to 174 million tons whilst thermal coal increased by 3.3 per cent to 306 million tons, with total coal seaborne trade expanding by 1.5 per cent to reach 480 million tons. World trade in grain increased by 7.1 per cent to 210 million tons in 1999. Steel production, iron ore and coal trades 79. World crude steel production increased by 1.3 per cent to 787 million tons in 1999. As in the previous year, strong regional differences in production prevailed in 1999. In Asia, China's crude steel production rose by 8.0 per cent to 123.7 million tons in 1999 from the previous year's level, while Japan's crude steel production increased to 94.2 million tons from 93.5 million tons in 1998. The Republic of Korea expanded its production by 2.9 per cent to 41.0 million tons whilst that of Taiwan Province of China decreased by 9.0 per cent to 15.4 million tons. Total production of the four major Asian producers grew by 3.5 per cent to 274.3 million tons or 34.9 per cent of the world total. The output of European Union member countries decreased by 3.0 per cent to 155.4 million tons. The United States' production dropped by 1.4 per cent to 97.3 million tons while the former Soviet Union experienced a strong growth to 85.8 million tons in 1999 from 74.4 million tons in 1998. The world seaborne trade in iron ore declined by 80. 1.7 per cent to 410 million tons in 1999 from 417 million tons in 1998. Exports from Brazil decreased by 5 per cent to 135 million tons, whereas Australia registered an increase of 3 per cent to 136 million tons. Canada's iron ore exports continued to decline by approximately 14 per cent to about 27 million tons in 1999, while Sweden's exports also decreased by as much as 13 per cent to 14 million tons. In 1999, world coal shipments continued to increase by 1.5 per cent to 480 million tons from 473 million tons in the previous year. Exports from Australia maintained strong growth in 1999. China's coal exports rose significantly by 19 per cent to 38 million tons, whereas South Africa's exports fell by 3 per cent to 63 million tons. Coal exports from the United States in 1999 plunged dramatically to 37 million tons from 52 million tons in 1998, while Canada's coal exports declined by 3 per cent to 34 million tons in 1999. Coal exports from Indonesia in 1999 expanded by as much as 20 per cent to 48 million tons. On the importing side, both Japan and the Republic of Korea increased their coal imports by 4 per cent each to 137 million tons and 55 million tons respectively in 1999. Imports into Taiwan Province of China were up by 10 per cent to 41 million tons. Grain trade 81. World grain shipments in 1999 increased by 7.1 per cent to 210 million tons. Trading patterns changed with large fluctuations during the year. The United States' exports increased remarkably by about 18.3 per cent to 87.9 million tons, while Canada and Australia also expanded their respective supplies by 6.2 per cent and 8.7 per cent to 19.3 million tons and 20.6 million tons respectively. Argentina's exports plummeted by 28.7 per cent to 17.3 million tons, whilst the European Union's supply to third countries increased by 17.2 per cent to 21.3 million tons. (b) Dry bulk freight rates In 1999, the dry bulk supply and demand balance 82. showed a clear improvement. The year ended with rates for all sizes of dry bulk carriers at significantly higher levels than in 1998. Total operational activities of dry bulk shipping have increased by 0.7 per cent in terms of ton-miles in sharp contrast to a decrease of 3.8 per cent in 1998. The dry bulk carrier fleet increased by 0.2 per cent to 276.1 million dwt. The growth in demand was notably higher during the second half of 1999 compared to the first half, specifically with strong demand from Asia for both coal and iron ore. Lay-up of dry bulk and combined carriers decreased to 2.2 million dwt in 1999 from 2.4 million dwt, and tonnage for storage remained minimal (see table 39). Dry bulk time-charter (trips) 83. The overall average time-charter trip rates rose favourably in 1999, as compared with those in 1998, on the four major trade routes, i.e. Atlantic round voyage, Pacific round voyage, Continent/Far East and Far East/Continent. The annual average rate for modern Capesize tonnage on the four major trade routes climbed

60 favourably in 1999, as compared with those in 1998, on the four major trade routes, i.e. Atlantic round voyage, Pacific round voyage, Continent/Far East and Far East/Continent. The annual average rate for modern Capesize tonnage on the four major trade routes climbed dramatically by 67.0 per cent, to $17,200 per day in 1999 from $10,300 per day in 1998, when the rates had fallen by 41 per cent from the 1997 level. For the Atlantic round voyage, the tonnage was employed at the average rate of $16,700 per day in 1999, whereas it was only paid at $8,600 per day in 1998. In the Pacific trade, the average rate rose to $16,700 per day in 1999 from $11,700 per day in 1998. The annual average rate for modern Panamax tonnage on the four major trade routes was up significantly by 58.2 per cent to $8,700 per day in 1999, as compared with $5,500 per day in 1998. A round voyage in the Atlantic was paid at the average rate of $8,400 per day in 1999, while it washired at $4,600 per day in 1998. In the Pacific it was employed at $9,300 in 1999, as compared with $5,900 per day in the previous year. Modern Handymax tonnages on the four major trade routes were employed at the annual average rate of $7,500 per day in 1999, which turned out to be 21 per cent higher than the daily rate of $5,900 in 1998. For the Atlantic round voyage, the average rate of $7,300 per day was paid in 1999, while the charter-hire for the same trade in 1998 was registered at $5,200 per day. In the Pacific trade, the rates averaged round $7,100 per day in 1999, as compared with $6,500 per day in 1998.10 voyages for Table 39 Dry cargo freight indices, 1997 - 2000 (monthly figures) Period January February March April May June July August September October November December Annual average Dry cargo tramp time-charter a (1995 - 100) Dry cargo tramp trip-charter b (July 1965 to June 1966 - 100) 1997 1998 1999 2000 1997 1998 1999 2000 81 84 88 86 79 78 84 87 82 80 77 73 82 71 62 68 68 64 60 55 53 52 57 56 50 60 46 49 60 59 68 64 63 66 70 79 80 82 66 86 89 101 107 108 98 209 197 199 197 190 184 183 196 190 191 189 186 193 189 186 171 173 173 177 167 165 164 165 170 168 172 166 170 169 172 173 176 179 178 185 185 195 192 178 190 191 190 191 193 191 Note: All indices have been rounded to the nearest whole number. a b Compiled by the German Ministry of Transport.

61 Dry bulk time-charter (periods) 84. In early 1999, a modern Capesize tonnage was hired on a 12-month time-charter at around $9,000 per day. In May, when some signals of the slow recovery of dry bulk markets in Asia emerged, a modern 150,000 dwt bulker was fixed at $9,000 per day for 12 months by an Asian operator. During the first 7 months, about 7 million dwt of dry cargo ships were destined for the scrapyard. In the middle of August 1999, it was reported that a Belgian operator had chartered about 30 modern Capesize tonners on a period time-charter. This big deal helped period time-charter markets to improve by $2,000B3,000 per day. The period time-charter market for Panamax experienced its lowest levels in the first quarter of 1999. In April, a modern Panamax was fixed at $6,250 per day for 12 months, and a similar tonnage was employed at $8,500 per day for three years with an option for a fourth and fifth year at $10,500 per day and $11,500 per day respectively. In early May a Panamax was chartered at $7,750 per day for 12 months. In the second half of 1999, the Panamax period time-charter market improved somewhat. However, in the 1999 overall Panamax time-charter markets, there was a relatively big gap between the trip market and the medium-period market. remained unsatisfactory for owners mainly due to the uncertainty of cargo movements, which demanded medium-period employment of niche Panamax tonners. Average period time-charter rates for Handymax dry bulkers were about $7,400 per day for 12 months in 1999, which was somewhat of an improvement over 1998.11 The latter Dry bulk trip-charter The year 1999 started in dismal circumstances for 85. Capesize tonnages, with no encouraging signs in sight. Rates stood at record low levels in most trades, with iron ore shipments for Tubarao (Brazil)/Rotterdam being paid at $3.50 per ton. Iron ore trades on the Brazil/China route Tonnages for the were paid at $4.90 per ton. Richards Bay/Rotterdam coal trade were hired at $4.25 per ton. From July until October 1999, charter- rates for Capesize increased significantly. Rates for the iron ore trade on the Brazil/China route stood at $8.65 per ton in October and climbed further to $11.00 per ton in November. Coal shipments from Australia to Europe moved from the lowest rate of $5.50 per ton in January 1999 to $11.25 per ton in November of that year. Taking the development of iron ore trades as a reference rate, the average freight rate for iron ore on the Brazil/Europe (Rotterdam) in Capesize vessels was up to $4.43 per ton in 1999 from $4.17 per ton in 1998. Fluctuations were significant in the rate of $3.20B6.50 with the highest rate towards the end of 1999. The reference rate for coal from Hampton Roads/Richards Bay to the Far East in Capesize tonnages increased from an annual average of $8.68 per ton in 1998 to $8.80 per ton in 1999. 86. The year 1999 was a very volatile and unpredictable year for the Panamax dry bulker market. While the market begun by being very dull in the first half of 1999, at the end of June that year it declined sharply owing to the lack of grain cargo. After a summer of uncertainty, an optimistic view finally began to be taken as demand in key Far Eastern countries started to expand. As a reference rate level for Panamax tonnages, the average freight rate for grain on the United States Gulf/Japan route in Panamax size increased by 19 per cent from an annual average of $15.34 per ton in 1998 to $18.50 per ton in 1999. Fluctuations were significant in the range from $13.85 per ton in January to $22.79 per ton in November 1999. The trip-charter market for Handysize bulkers during the year 1999 was characterized by as many ups as downs, which did not help the market to find stability.12 C. CRUDE OIL AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS SEABORNE FREIGHT MARKET (a) Seaborne trade in crude oil and petroleum products In 1999, world crude oil production decreased by 87. 1.5 per cent or approximately 1.0 million barrels per day from the level of 1998. Accordingly the overall volume of the seaborne crude oil trade declined by 2.0 per cent to 1,600.5 million tons. This was somewhat offset by shipments of petroleum products in 1999, which increased by 2.0 per cent to 559 million tons. In 1999, it was observed in the world tanker market that activities for tonnage pooling continued among major owners, and that tanker-chartering practices to combine smaller oil cargo lots into larger vessels were being adopted by charterers, such as major petroleum enterprises. Furthermore, on the chartering-in side, Petrofina, Total and Elf decided to merge their chartering activities. Similarly, Repsol, YPF and Arco decided to join BP/Amoco. Thus, there seems to be a clear tendency for major charterers to become fewer and larger. (b) Tanker freight rates The tanker balance between supply and demand 88. deteriorated overall in 1999. The tanker fleet in 1999 increased by 1.1 per cent to 282.5 million dwt, following the growth of 2.8 per cent in 1998. Laid-up tankers

62 increased from 1.6 million dwt in 1998 to 2.1 million dwt in 1999 (0.7 per cent of the total tanker fleet) and storage also increased by 0.1 million dwt to 3.2 million dwt in 1999 (1.1 per cent of the total tanker fleet) respectively. The tonnage utilization rate was rather favourable in the first quarter of 1999; however it began to slow down in the early summer when OPEC's production was reduced. Towards the end of the year, oil output and trade volume decreased further. Under these circumstances, shipping performance for crude oil decreased by 3.8 per cent in terms of ton-miles in 1999 whilst that for petroleum products increased by 2.0 per cent. Very large crude carriers (VLCCs) 89. The year 1999 was difficult for owners of VLCCs, who were adversely affected by the shortage of cargo in the trades from the Middle East Gulf owing to the reduction of OPEC output. Consequently, VLCCs were increasingly engaged on the trade routes from West Africa in 1999, where smaller tonnages such as Suezmax tankers are typically employed. The OPEC agreement to cut crude oil output hit any hopes of a recovery of rates in the large tanker sector, for the Middle East Gulf loading in particular. VLCC shipments from the Middle East Gulf fell to the low WS 40s to Asian destinations by April 1999, with one fixture dropping to the high WS 30s. Depressed VLCC rates had a knock-on effect in the markets other than the Middle East Gulf, as owners sought cargoes for their VLCCs elsewhere, such as West Africa to the United States where freights were around WS 50B55 and to Asia where rates of up to WS 42 were paid. In May 1999, increased liftings booked for July 1999 loading boosted VLCC rates from the Middle East Gulf, especially eastbound. Asian discharge trades pushed into the WS 50s and as high as WS 57 for Japanese ports. However, this was only a temporary peak, and later in the period rates eased down to around WS 50. In June and July 1999, rates for VLCCs from the Middle East Gulf plunged back below WS 40 as cargo for Far Eastern destinations dried up. From August 1999, high crude oil prices actually dampened what owners had hoped to be an upturn in demand as the northern winter approached and stockpiling took place as usual, while VLCCs were fixed from the Middle East Gulf to Asian destinations at WS 50, the end of September 1999 to WS 55. On the other hand, western destinations earned about WS 50. In October 1999, despite strong trading volumes for crude oil shipments, VLCC rates slipped back slightly, to about WS 45 to eastern destinations, with rates for Europe-bound cargo about 2 points below that. Liftings from West Africa for Asian destinations were also hovering in the WS 40s. In November 1999, VLCC rates to the Far East, such as the rising by Republic of Korea and Japan, fluctuated around WS 50 as demand picked up. Similarly, in West Africa rates for VLCCs also reflected favourable returns, paid at WS 55 to the United States Gulf. Towards the end of the year, a lack of VLCC tonnage and owners holding out caused rates to firm. Rates for over 250,000 tonners from the Middle East Gulf to the Republic of Korea reached the mid- to high WS 60s. 90. In 1999 the average rates paid for VLCC transportation from the Middle East Gulf declined; the average rate for voyages to the West was WS 46.16, as compared with WS 58.2 recorded in 1998. On voyages to Japan, the average was WS 50.78 while it was WS 66.9 in 1998. These lower rates, coupled with doubled bunker prices during the whole year, strained the operational economies of most VLCC owners. In this context it is notable that 36 VLCC/ULCC units were sold for demolition in 1999, of which 32 were turbine tankers which proved to be uneconomical to operate in a market with low freight rates and increased bunker prices. Medium-sized crude carriers 91. In the West African market, Suezmax tankers were paid at an average rate of only WS 75.28 in 1999 on voyages to the United States Atlantic coast, which compares with WS 82.80 in 1998. In 1999, 18 Suezmax newbuildings were delivered, while 27 Suezmax units were sold for demolition, thus the size of the Suezmax fleet actually diminished, but remained the major tonnage in the whole area of the Atlantic basin. However, the rates for this size of tonnage were poor. One of the reasons for this weak market can be seen in the increasing utilization of VLCCs in markets such as West Africa, which had been traditional domains of Suezmax tonnages. The main operating routes of Suezmax are transatlantic from West African loading areas into the relatively shallow-draught United States East Coast where Suezmaxes' lesser draught makes it easier for them to approach these ports than VLCCs. On these trade routes, Suezmax with 1 million-barrel capacity competes very often with VLCC (2 million-barrel capacity) to secure cargo lots of more than 2 million-barrels if the discharging ports can accommodate VLCCs. When VLCC markets are depressed in the Middle East Gulf, owners search employments for loading in West Africa on the way back after discharge in Europe. As freight rates for Suezmax tonnage are expected to rise and VLCCs are available for loading in West Africa, charterers are induced to combine two one-million-barrel cargo lots into one for a VLCC. When rates for VLCCs rise in their main trades from the Middle East Gulf, rates for Suezmaxes for loading in West Africa also pick up

63 under less competition with the VLCCs for West African loading. In January 1999, average VLCC rates were WS 62, then coming down and stagnating at around WS 40 from the end of the first quarter to the middle of the third quarter, when rates picked up. A similar trend was observed in Suezmaxes' chartering activities from West Africa to the United States. In January 1999, freight rates were paid at WS 85, since then continuously plummeting and were in the doldrums at WS 50B60 from the second quarter to the beginning of the third quarter. For the third quarter of 1999, Suezmax fixtures in West Africa had been maintained at the level of high WS 70s. During the next four months, Suezmax liftings from West Africa managed to obtain WS 67 for European discharge and WS 65 to the United States Gulf. Similarly, Mediterranean loading tonnages were paid at WS 65B75 to Northern European destinations. In August 1999, lack of cargoes sent Suezmax rates plummeting. Rates for intra-Mediterranean cargoes dipped below WS 60 to about WS 55, while cargoes from West Africa for the United States managed to secure WS 52. When the last quarter began, demand for crude oil in preparation for the winter season in the northern hemisphere increased gradually. Suezmax demand remained relatively stable with North Sea fixtures at around WS 70 for the United States discharge, and West African liftings at WS 72 for the same destination. Towards the end of the year, these rates further improved up to the same level as at the end of 1998, at around WS 90. in Aframax tonnages experienced unfavourable 92. markets, specifically the first half of 1999. Forty-three Aframax newbuildings were delivered against only 27 units sold to the breakers. The average rates in the three major loading areas for Aframax tankers, the Mediterranean, North Sea and Caribbean, were down by about 5 per cent in 1999 compared to the average paid in 1998. Approximately 27 per cent of the Aframax fleet existing in 1999 was built in 1980 or before. These old Aframaxes were virtually excluded from trading to the United States owing to that country's regulations, and thus were employed for other destinations, adversely affecting market rates thereof. During the first quarter of 1999, Aframax tonnages for North Sea loading were paid at WS 85B95 for European discharge. As the summer season approached in the northern hemisphere, Aframax tonnages suffered a fall in freights as the summer maintenance period in the North Sea, coupled with the seasonal reduction in volumes from the Caribbean, reduced rates for 80,000 tons to WS 80 for North Sea liftings. From May to August 1999, Aframax rates edged down, with 80,000 tons for North Sea loading to European continental destinations paid at WS 80, and further slipped to the middle of the WS 70s. Similar trends in freights were observed in the Caribbean and Mediterranean markets. Towards the end of 1999, demand for Aframax tonnages became firmer with increased cargo bookings creating a shortage of this size of tanker. Rates for 80,000 tons to Japan from the Middle East Gulf went as high as WS 120, while freights for cargoes from the Mediterranean to northern Europe reached WS 115. Intra-Europe trades in 80,000 tonners paid up to WS 160. Small crude and product carriers 93. In 1999, many of the major markets for product carriers took a beating. This was coupled with the entry of larger product carriers such as Aframaxes, both coated and uncoated, to replace niche tankers which dominated the 50,000B60,000 ton market, i.e. the Middle East Gulf to the Far East. The product market was already down to WS 135 for 55,000 tons and WS 110 for 75,000 tons at the beginning of 1999. The rates continued to be under pressure and drifted at the level of WS 100B110 for 60,000B70,000 tons until October. Towards the end of the year, owing to the relatively brighter prospect for winter consumption, rates recovered to the WS 150s. Handy-size clean and dirty carriers 94. In 1999 the Republic of Korea increased refinery capacity and developed its trade in products for the Japanese and Chinese markets, while expanding further to North and South America. India also increased its production capacity with new refineries, and Venezuela secured a larger market share in central and west coast South America. These developments affected movements of oil products from the Middle East Gulf. Rates for 30,000 tons on the Middle East GulfBIndian subcontinent route stagnated at WS 140s in the first half of 1999. As West African suppliers came on stage during the second and third quarters in 1999, attracting this sector of ships, rates for loading at the Middle East Gulf improved, standing at WS 175 for 40,000 tons destined for the Indian subcontinent towards the end of the year. The Atlantic market remained stable, specifically in the firsthalf of the year. A 33,000 for Europe/United States stood at the rate of WS 165-175. In the second half of the year, this rate came down to WS 140-145.

An active seasonal market came to the Caribbean where rates reached as high as WS 240 for 30,000 tons in July, but declined somewhat in August. The Caribbean trades remained flat just below WS 200 for this size through September-November. As usual, towards the end of the year, a temporary increase in demand lifted the rates up to WS 230 for 30,000-ton cargoes destined for the United States East Coast. built 41,000 dwt product tanker was paid at $11,000 per day for 12 months. In June, another 1991-built unit was fixed at a relatively higher rate of $12,600 per day. The July-September period marked the doldrums when period time-charter rates for 30,000 dwt product carriers built in the early 1990s went to around $10,000 per day for a 12-month charter. Activity for clean, product carriers remained low until December, when eight vessels were chartered with 45,000 dwt class paid at $12,000 per day and 30,000 dwt class at $10,500 per day. Tanker period-charter market D. ESTIMATES OF TOTAL FREIGHT COSTS IN WORLD TRADE The period time-charter market was directly 95. influenced by the weak spot market, which prevailed throughout the year. Many charterers were reluctant to take period coverage when relatively cheap employment of tankers was available in the spot market. In general in 1999, the period-charter market was therefore less active than observed in previous years. A major operator took three VLCCs for a period of five years at the rate of approximately $29,500 per day. Activity in the Suezmax sector of the period market was also very limited. Early in the year, a European charterer extended a double-hull Suezmax at a minimum rate and profit-sharing; the minimum rate on this deal was about $18,000 per day. A Norwegian charterer extended two Suezmaxes with a floor rate as well as $14,000 per day and a profit sharing above this level. A Venezuelan charterer secured a double-hull Suezmax at $17,200 per day. Owners of Aframaxes also experienced poor period chartering activities during 1999. The only positive aspect was that the Aframax period market was more active than other sectors and offered a wider field of choice. A newbuilding double-hull Aframax was chartered by a Norwegian charterer at the beginning of the year at $15,300 per day for 12 months. As the year approached its end, rates for a double-hull Aframax were closer to $13,000 per day. The period time-charter market for petroleum 96. products reflected the gloom in the spot market and the flood of newbuilding deliveries. At the beginning of the year, an early 1990s-built 47,000 dwt product carrier obtained $12,500 per day for a 12-month charter. Since then, the market continued to slide. In May, a 1990s- Trends in global import value and freight costs 97. International trade involves various services such as production, marketing, transaction and transport, and the related flow of information thereof. In the transport sector, table 41 provides estimates of total freight payments for imports and the percentage of total import value by country groups (see also graph 8). In 1998, the world total value of imports (c.i.f.) decreased by 2.2 per cent, while total freights paid for transport services also declined by 5.6 per cent. Notwithstanding the above, the share of global freight payments in import value further improved to 5.06 per cent from 5.24 per cent in 1997. In 1980 the share of freight costs in import value stood at 6.64 per cent or nearly 30 per cent higher than the average ratio in the 1990s. The regional comparison indicates that freight costs incurred in the imports of developed market- economy countries continue to be nearly half that of developing countries, with the difference between the two groups remaining almost unchanged or tending to widen slightly. For 1998, the total value of imports by developed market-economy countries increased by 1.7 per cent while total freight costs decreased by 0.7 per cent, thus standing at 4.07 per cent (4.17 per cent in 1997) as compared to 8.06 per cent (8.04 per cent in 1997) in developing countries. This was mainly attributable to differences in trade structures, regional infrastructure facilities, distribution systems, and the more influential shipping strategy of shippers of developed market- economy countries.

Regional trends 98. Large variations in freight costs ratios were observed among the countries of each of the groups. Among the major trading nations with an import value of more than $100 billion, in the group of developed market-economy countries Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom incurred lower freight cost ratios in the range of 2.4B2.8 per cent. The United States and France registered moderate ratios of 3.2 per cent in 1998. On the other hand, Japan recorded a ratio as high as 8.1 per cent followed by Italy (6.4 per cent) and Spain (5.6 per cent), in comparison to 4.1 per cent for the developed market- economy countries as a group. The higher ratios of these countries can be attributable primarily to higher distribution costs including involvement of many traders. 99. Total freight costs of developing countries steadily decreased from 8.60 per cent in 1990 to 8.06 per cent in 1998. Within this group, African developing countries, however, continued slowly but steadily on an upward trend in freight costs from 11.05 per cent in 1990 to 11.53 per cent in 1997 and 11.36 per cent in 1998. This trend towards higher infrastructure ratios mainly insufficient reflects inadequate management practices, facilities and specifically for transit transport, and low productivity of inland-transport and terminal equipment. The subregional breakdown shows that the freight costs of West Africa slightly increased to 13.40 per cent in 1998 while those of Eastern and Southern Africa including the Indian Ocean stood at 13.71 per cent. The ratio of Northern Africa remained almost unchanged at 9.00 per cent, reflecting benefit from a relatively more efficient transport system compared to those of other African subregions. The imports of African landlocked countries continued to suffer from high freight costs, which primarily reflect inefficient transport organization and facilities, poor utilization of assets and weak managerial, procedural, regulatory and institutional systems, apart from inadequate overall infrastructure conditions: the ratio of Malawi remained at 39 per cent, while for Mali and Rwanda the ratio was 30 per cent each, and for Burkina Faso and Chad it was in the range of 21B26 per cent. 100. Developing countries in Asia accounted for nearly 60 per cent of import value in 1998 and also of freight payments of all developing countries as compared to 64 per cent each in 1997. This decline

68 explained by a remarkable decrease in imports of manufactures from non-Asian countries, owing to the adverse effect of a substantial depreciation in the value of Asian currency. The freight factor of this region has fluctuated around 8 per cent since 1990, standing at 8.11 per cent in 1998, as compared with 7.95 per cent in 1997. The freight factor in West Asia was 8.73 per cent in 1998, with about 13 per cent for Kuwait and the Islamic Republic of Iran as the highest in this subregion. The freight factor in South and East Asia was 7.98 per cent in 1998. The Republic of Korea and Singapore paid freight costs at about 5.5 per cent, the lowest level in this region, whilst India and Indonesia incurred the highest freight costs in the subregion at about 10.5 per cent. Malaysia and Thailand also paid freight costs as high as around 9.5 per cent. These variations in freight factors can be attributed mainly to differences in trade structure and shipping patterns in the liner sector, where countries not covered by main line services tend to be placed at a relative disadvantage. 101. Developing countries in America as a whole continued to pay the cheapest freight costs for their imports of all the developing countries, with a freight factor of 6.86 per cent in 1998 compared to 8.17 per cent in 1990. Within this region, Central America had the lowest freight factor of 5.12 per cent in 1997. This relatively low ratio is largely attributable to the fact that Mexico, the biggest trading nation in the region, had the lowest freight factor of 4.42 per cent, while actually accounting for 85.6 per cent of the total c.i.f. value of imports of the subregion (37.4 per cent of all American developing countries) and paying 73.9 per cent of the total freight costs of the subregion (24.1 per cent for the whole region) in 1998. The countries of the South American eastern seaboard continued to pay relatively low freight costs at 6.65 per cent. Among these countries, Uruguay benefited from the advantage of direct services, paying as little as 4.5 per cent. Argentina and Brazil followed, paying 6.5 per cent each. The countries of the South American western seaboard registered the rate of 8.88 per cent. Colombia paid the cheapest freights of this subregion at 6.4 per cent, while Peru incurred the highest freight factor of 16.4 per cent. The countries on the northern seaboard continued to pay relatively higher freights at 10.2 per cent. The landlocked countries in the Americas, Bolivia and Paraguay, continued to remain among the high-freight-paying countries in the region with the ratio of 11.0 per cent each, while their freight factor was much lower than those of African landlocked countries. in Small island developing countries 102. the Caribbean and Oceania continued to pay higher freights at 11-12 per cent in 1998. These high costs reflect the high freight rates for ocean transport, which is the most important life-line for island developing countries. The long distances from major trade partners, low cargo volumes, high transhipment and feeder costs also largely contribute to the high levels of freight costs.

Chapter V PORT DEVELOPMENT This chapter covers container port hroughput for developing countries, improving port performance, institutional changes in ports and special needs of small ports. A. CONTAINER PORT TRAFFIC 103. Table 42 gives the latest available figures on reported world container port traffic in developing countries and territories for 1997 and 1998. The world growth rate for container port throughput (number of movements measured in TEUs) increased to 6.7 per cent in 1998 from 2.6 per cent in 1997, which is closer to the annual containerized throughput growth rate of 9 per cent experienced during the first half of the decade. The throughput for 1998 (1997) was over 165.0 (as against 154.6) million TEUs, which is an annual increase of slightly over 10.4 (3.9) million TEUs. The rate of growth for developing countries and 104. territories was 12.6 per cent in 1998 with a total throughput of 88.5 million TEUs (accounting for slightly more than 53 per cent of total throughput), which was an increase compared to the 3.1 per cent growth rate in 1997. Countries with double digit growth in both 1997 and 1998 were the Republic of Korea, Panama, Malta, Venezuela, Argentina, Honduras, Bangladesh, Trinidad and Tobago and Mauritius. The growth in developing countries is uneven from year to year, owing sometimes to strong fluctuations in trade and sometimes to improved data or lack of data. 105. Initial figures for 1999 are available for the main ports, including those of developing countries and of the socialist countries of Asia, with seven ports from these countries ranking among the top 20 container ports. Their throughput is shown in table 43, together with the annual percentage increase for each of the past two years. In 1999, Hong Kong (China) bounced back with double digit growth to become the world leader in total number of movements, overtaking Singapore which had its growth rate fall to 5.3 per cent. This is a good result for Hong Kong, reflecting the economic recovery in Asia and paralleled with strong growth through other Chinese ports on the mainland. The port of Shanghai had a percentage change of 37.3 per cent or an increase of 1,144,000 TEUs and the ports of Yantian and Qingdao were also in the top 30 ports for the first time. This reflects the continued growth of Chinese exports, especially to North America and Europe. B. IMPROVING PORT PERFORMANCE 106. Changing trade flows and the competitive strategies of the vessel operators are impinging on the way in which port authorities and terminal operators must adapt. Pressure is being exerted to cut costs and to provide services for a new fleet of mega-vessels now being brought on stream. At the same time port investment requirements have skyrocketed. The expansion is being driven by two pressures. First, the overall container volume continues to grow and outlook for trade expansion appears favourable. Secondly, the arrival of the mega-vessels, 5,000 TEUs and greater, is driving the need for transhipment hubs and for feeder ports. To be considered as a hub, ports must have post- Panamax cranes, deep water, a large amount of back-up land, and direct intermodal connections, often via on-dock rail. However few ports have meaningful guarantees that their investment in facilities will be recaptured. Ports choosing to become hubs are extremely vulnerable to the changing fortunes and desires of both large shipping lines and alliances. 107. One means of cutting costs that is appropriate for terminals with high labour costs and with proven ability to maintain hi-tech equipment is through automation. ECT's Rotterdam operation is roughly 50 per cent automated and PSA Corp has invested in this type of technology for its Pasir Panjang terminal. Thamesport in England, as a relatively new t erminal, has

In 1998, the terminal handled over 500,000 TEU with 360 staff, of which 150 are traditional dock workers. All operations at the terminal are regulated by a central computer system. Six post-Panamax ship-to-shore cranes work the vessels. For the discharge operation, the crane driver inputs the container serial number into the central computer. The computer then informs the tractor driver to which of the nine stacks in the container yard he has to deliver the container. There are 18 rail?mounted gantries (RMG), which are fully automated without drivers. The RMG picks up the container and the central computer informs the crane where to stack it. Lorry drivers coming to pick up imports or drop off exports are given smart cards. These allow the control centre to place drivers in queues and regulate loading and unloading to maximize efficiency. Lorry drivers go to the stack entrances where their containers are taken from or into the stack by the RMG. The next step in automation is the planned installation of automatic guided vehicles for the transfer operation between stack and ship. Increasing terminal productivity and performance 108. will increase terminal capacity without capital investment. To achieve this, efficient and cost effective connections to the hinterland of a port are required. On-dock rail systems are one method of providing freight transport efficiency. This is a system where the rail-heads end as near to the quayside as possible, so that the boxes can be transferred from the ship into the yard and then on to rail.

This lessens the need for sizable terminal yards and separate intermodal exchange facilities. An added advantage of the system is the use of the more environmentally-friendly transport mode of rail rather than road. 109. An example of this system is in the US port of Tacoma at Hyundai Merchant Marine Terminal. The terminal has a quay length of 600 meters, a container yard area of 24.3 hectares and a rail yard of 8.1 hectares. The handling equipment consists of four post-Panamax ship-to-shore gantries, a fleet of reach stackers and terminal tractors. The direct ship to rail transfer works with the tractor-trailers taking the containers from the cranes and hauling them 300 meters to the rail yard where the reach stackers transfer them on to the rail wagons. Container dwell time in the terminal has been reduced to 8 to 12 hours versus the normal dwell time of 6 to 7 days with road trucks. In October 110. 1999, Ceres Terminals Incorporated, through their Dutch company, and Amsterdam Port Authority, started work on a new container terminal concept for the mega-ships. The first phase of the terminal will have three berths, two marginal ones and one 'indented' berth - totalling 1,050 meters of berthing capacity. The indented berth will allow a minimum of 300 moves per hour with up to ten cranes working both sides of the ship. The indented berth is 64 metres wide and 400 metres long and can accommodate ships with a maximum beam of 50 metres. The cranes have an outreach of 22 containers and will be serviced by a fleet of 39 of the latest straddle carriers. The straddle carriers have a lifting capacity of 50 tons, lift one-over-three and use a Global Positioning System (GPS) linked to a yard management computer system. Two-thirds of the costs are being financed by the Amsterdam Port Authority and the remainder by Ceres. The area of the first phase is 50.6 hectares and is scheduled to be completed in 2001, and a second phase of 68.8 hectares with a second indented berth will be operational in 2003. C. INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE the operating Large multi-port companies 111. continued to seek new operating concessions, thus consolidating towards public/private partnerships in the container terminal sector. The firms are Hutchinson Port major Holdings (HPH), PSA Corp, P&O Ports, International Container Terminals Incorporated. international trend 112. HPH operates at present in 18 ports in the Bahamas, China, Indonesia, Myanmar and Panama, and in 1999 estimated that it handled about 10 per cent of global port container throughput. Other major terminal operators are P&O Ports with 21 container terminals in 19 countries and interests in a further 30 ports. Their terminals are found in the following developing countries with the approximate volumes in thousands of TEUs shown in brackets (Argentina (500), China (750), India (470), Indonesia (1,100), Mozambique (25), Pakistan (190), the Philippines (540), Sri Lanka (310), and Thailand (340)). PSA Corp, in addition to four terminals in Singapore, operates eight others in Brunei, China (Dalian and Fuzhou), India (Tuticorin and Pipavav), Italy, Portugal and Yemen and has entered into an agreement to manage a terminal in Inchon, Republic of Korea. International Container Terminal Services, Inc. (ICTSI), in addition to Manila, operates one terminal in Argentina, two in Mexico, and one each in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Republic of Tanzania. Stevedoring Services of America (SSA) and Ceres Terminals operate mostly the United States. SSA operates seven terminals in the United States and one terminal in Panama. Ceres provides stevedoring and terminal operations in 20 locations throughout North America as well as in Amsterdam, Odessa and Moscow. in 113. South America's privatization of ports is continuing, especially in the Mercosur countries, with the exception of Uruguay, where several attempts to privatize the container terminal in Montevideo have failed. In Chile, the container terminals in Valparaiso and San Antonio, plus the multi-purpose terminal at San Vicente have been leased to private companies as operating concessions. In each case the prices paid were well above initial expectations. 114. In Brazil, the privatized terminals in Santos, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande and Paranagua have all achieved better traffic performances. The terminal operators in Santos have made big improvements in productivity rates and efficiency levels. This has resulted from the programme to upgrade equipment, from the improved balance in trade and from fewer ships with more cargo. In Rio de Janeiro, since privatization, the waiting time for a berth of from 24 to 30 hours has been eliminated, and crane productivity has improved from six moves per hour up to 20. There is still need for reform in the high manning levels for working container vessels and that will allow the lowering of cargo handling charges. There are a number of smaller Brazilian ports that are

in the process of asking for tenders from private companies to operate their container facilities. 115. In Argentina, the various private terminal operators in Buenos Aires have continued to invest in new equipment, although cargo flows are expected to decline by at least 10 per cent in 1999 as a result of the Brazilian currency devaluation. A consortium led by Manila-based ICTSI won a concession to operate the container terminal in the port of Rosario and a programme to upgrade the facilities was started. However, the operator faced heavy losses and the consortium has subsequently withdrawn from the lease. D. SPECIAL NEEDS OF SMALL PORTS 116. To better understand the needs of the least developed countries in their port sector the following extract has been made from a study on port development for an island least developed country. The Republic of Kiribati consists of 33 islands scattered over 4,500 km east-west and 1,800 km north-south of a wide expanse of the Central Pacific Ocean and has at present a population of about 80,000. Tarawa atoll, where Betio Port is located, is isolated at a distance of about 4,500 km from a major trade partner Australia, about 4,300 km from New Zealand, and 5,200 km from Japan. Almost all the islands of the country consist of coral atolls with poor soil for agricultural activities and hence depend on imports for most foods and other necessities. Major export commodities are copra and fish. However, the trade balance has shown a heavy deficit since the exhaustion of phosphate reserves in 1979. these peculiar geographical and social Due to conditions, sea lifeline transport constitutes a supporting Kiribati's economic activities, while port facilities are indispensable infrastructure connecting sea and land transport for foreign and domestic cargoes. ago. In that were undertaken about 30 years consequence, Betio Port experiences problems of inefficient and unsafe port operations due to the deterioration of its facilities that lack the necessary capacity for the present trade. for modern trade without 118. The current situation of the deteriorated port is such that the port is unable to perform the functions urgent required rehabilitation and improvement. Betio Port further lacks the capacity to deal with containerization. Since large container ships cannot berth alongside the quay wall in the port, containers are transferred from ship to shore, or vice-versa, by using barges and a tug. This handling system reduces cargo handling efficiency. Full containers are handled only with a fixed tower crane in the container yard and are stacked 5 high within the reach of the crane. Average handling time for these containers stacked at random is about twice that of containers normally handled in other international ports. The extremely small area for stacking containers makes handling efficiency worse. Better management information systems could assist the port operator to improve performance in the port. to traffic 119. In Betio and the other outer island ports, maintenance dredging has been neglected resulting in difficult and inefficient entry and berthing operations for small vessels. In terms of containerized imports, container increase from is expected 1,600 TEU in 1993, to 2,500 in 2000 and 3,200 in 2005. Total tonnage will rise from about 62,000 tons in 1993 to 86,000 tons in 2000 and to 109,000 tons in 2005. A development plan to construct a new wharf allowing alongside berthing of 90 per cent of the ships calling at Betio Port has been drawn up. However, an economic analysis of the project shows a low internal rate of return because of the small volume of cargo and the large capital investment required to bring the facilities up to an international standard. 117. The major port of the country, Betio, the most important port of the Line Islands Group, London Wharf in Christmas Island and all the other outer island ports are suffering from a serious deterioration of their services because of a long absence of investment to improve facilities. Betio Port is the sole gateway for foreign trade and the centre of domestic sea transport. However, no significant work has been done on improving the port since the development works for port facilities for small boats 120. While this is an extreme case, it illustrates the problem that ports in the least developing countries are facing. There are 32 LDCs that border the ocean, of which 11 are island countries. The improvements required are essential for the sound growth of the countries' economies, but the low rate of return deters the private sector from either lending or investing funds. Consequently governments must often depend on ODA or loans on concessionary terms to make the required improvements, although the amount of these funds continues to decline.

Chapter VI TRADE AND TRANSPORT EFFICIENCY This chapter provides an update on the impact of the latest developments in the field of multimodal transport and on the emerging role of internet-based transportation service providers, as well as providing information developments in the legal sector and with training. A. DEVELOPMENTS TRANSPORT IN MULTIMODAL (a) General developments The year 1999 passed with one disturbing 121. question about what might happen after New Year's eve on 31 December 1999. The Year 2000 bug, commonly known as Y2K, was one of numerous potential disasters that many people, including transport operators, were doing their utmost to avoid. The bug was taken seriously because virtually everyone would be affected through the global interconnectivity of computer networks. Solving the problem would mean making sure that all computers correctly stated the date and time when they entered the millennium. Ignoring the problem would have a directly disruptive effect on institutions whose data precisions depended on the time element of database information, such as bank accounting, airline scheduling, market analysis, and many more. This disquiet had driven most of the world's major institutions to undertake basic computer software and hardware preparations to ensure that their worldwide computing networks were Y2K compliant. 122. International trading flows were among those heavily affected by the financial crisis experienced by Asia and Russia. In the area of trade facilitation, the impact of the crisis was also reflected by the negative growth and revenue of the container leasing and production industries that these countries had to endure during that period. The crisis was short-lived, however, and by the third quarter of 1999 demand had gradually improved in Asia and Russia alike. 123. E-commerce started to have an impact on the logistic industry. It began to redefine the efficiency of distribution by adding yet another dimension in the area of the supply chain. Bigger companies had begun cultivating the power of e-commerce to address the needs of their individual clients and distributors more efficiently by forming a community of supply-chains. The hope was that the new model of distribution would eventually reduce unnecessary inventory buildups held by trading partners. Analysts suggested that such a model would allow the distribution system to flow not in the traditional linear way but in more of a networked manner. In a similar way, E-trade facilitation had also given rise to a new type of trader who would offer and be able to facilitate interchanges of container equipment for shipping lines. Such traders, now called e-lessors, would grow to become an integral and important part of the players in the container leasing industry. (b) E-trade facilitation Trade facilitation now has a new dimension 124. "trade facilitation" (etf). The newly developed Internet technology, when combined with the vast knowledge and expertise of the shipping world, may become the centralizing environment for the complex and dispersed global industry of shipping. At one level, an etf web site may become a virtual marketplace that brings together transport users and providers from around the world. As a system, it helps to streamline the current overburdened administrative aspect of the transport industry. E-trade facilitation can be the catalyst for a substantial change which will redefine the management of trade within the industry.

76 125. A good example of an etf site may be the LevelSeas.com site. This provides market intelligence, online charting, pre- and post-fixture activities, risk management tools, and freight derivatives to constitute a comprehensive freight management service for the seaborne wet and dry bulk commodity shipping community. The site delivers added value to the participants of the industry by providing greater market access and greater efficiency, and by lowering costs. The site does not discriminate against any player in the industry. 126. Another type of etf instrument serves as a tool in helping to manage one segment of the supply chain. An example is that of stevedores and chief officers working interactively on the same stowage plan. Currently, a website developed by a joint effort of Canada-based Autoship Systems Corporation (ASC) and the Internet Service Provider/Active Server Pages (ISP/ASP)-provider Stargate allows for a load-planning software to be used remotely through the site. All that a user needs is a PC with an internet connection. Another site, called Vendor Interface, is also a new etf instrument, which provides a channel for managing the drayage segment of intermodal shipments. The site is developed by Cysive Inc. and Hub Group. The idea is to enable Hub Group and its drayage partners to keep permanently in touch by means of the Internet. The site is designed to improve operational efficiency, eliminate redundancy and provide processing of orders all day long. For shippers, the site offers increased information visibility throughout the supply chain, and high quality communication and tracking. For operators, such as Multimodal Transport Operators, on the other hand, the site become a means to select appropriate carriers for each shipment based on cost, dates, location and cargo. This is all done online, where shipments are offered for carriers, terms are set, and deliveries identified and authorized. 127. With a digitial camera, etf may help to reduce truck queues at marine container and intermodal terminal gates. By having webcams, digital cameras designed for the Internet, installed at the gates, one may access a designated site for information that would cut down on idle trucking time and help to track containers. Sites, such as eModal.com, gather information from shipping lines and sort and consolidate it into an easy-to-read format ready for enquiries on specific containers. 128. A more advanced etf system uses the latest and more sophisticated Global Positioning System/Global System for Mobile Communication (GPS/GSM) tracking unit. It has an antenna and dual band GSM modem. The unit is designed to locate moving units such as containers, trailers, trucks or rail freight cars. As a system, it gathers data from the unit to be processed and stored in an information centre where customers may obtain relevant information via fax, telephone, Short Message Service (SMS), Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) or over the Internet. As regards tracking transport equipments, the system would gather the positions and status of any number of tracking units installed on the equipment and process them into a formatted table that could be evaluated by any combination of fleet management or dispatching systems owned by customers. This system is now being used in Europe and is commonly known as the MobileHound SAM Cargo System. The system sends the gathered data to proTime "Fleet Services" information centre to be processed. 129. A simpler yet integrated system for monitoring all stages of the supply chain is also starting to evolve as another type of etf system. This supply chain monitoring system relies heavily on the information coming from all those involved with a shipment, such as producers, transporters and storage providers, freight forwarders and surveyors. The system processes the information to provide an unobstructed and timely view of critical logistics data. It also allows participants to sequence and optimize the bulk material supply function. Stolt-Nielsen SA the system, calling it TransLink, an internet-based, open logistics system for chemical and related materials shipped in bulk. implementing is currently 130. Sea Box, a US container trading and design company, established a virtual marketplace on the Internet, which is called ISOContainers.com, a site for buying intermodal equipment worldwide. It is a 24-hour service, which includes a real-time inventory that is globally available in over 200 international inland and port cities. Customers may enquire about the type, location, condition and cost of the equipment, as the facts are always updated every quarter of an hour. This is just another new feature of the evolving E-trade facilitation. (c) Container leasing industry A general overview 131. The container leasing industry has been in a difficult leasing market for the past few years. The utilization rate has deteriorated. The per diem rental rates and the prices of new boxes have plummeted, affecting the direct investment strategies of carriers and lessors alike.

77 in themselves Lessors have found 132. in direct competition with shipping lines and other transport terms of acquiring new containers. operators Responding to the drop in prices of new boxes, lines and other transport operators acquired about 720,000 TEU in 1998, which was a 30 per cent jump from the purchases made a year earlier. Lessors, on the other hand, were not fully able to adjust their rental rates to the fall in prices of new containers because of the massive number of boxes they bought when prices were substantially higher. The rental rates had to remain somewhat rigid in order to cover the depreciation cost of older boxes. The new and cheaper boxes acquired by carriers thus significantly reduced carriers' demand for the relatively more expensive leased containers. Responding to the weak world demand for containers, lessors consequently had to curtail their purchases for new containers, and in 1998 acquired only 755,000 TEU containers, i.e. 45,000 TEU less than what they bought a year earlier. The share of boxes owned by carriers, in the meantime, increased substantially in meeting world demand for containers. 133. In general, the weak world demand for leased containers had led to the worsening of the utilization rates of leased boxes and the growing stockpiles of idle containers at unattractive locations in Europe and North America. Indeed, lessors were facing tough times in generating a profit. Compared with the newcomers to the industry, long-established lessors were holding a wide range of equipment that had higher depreciation rates than their own replacement cost. Thus, besides restricting their purchases of new 134. containers, lessors began to look for other cost-saving strategies, such as fleet mergers and management takeovers, mainly to achieve economies of scale. As shown in table 44, Genstar and Sea Containers merged in 1998 to form GE SeaCo with a more than 1.1 million TEU making it the second largest player in the industry. Textainer Group decided to expand its fleet by acquiring smaller sized PriceSource in 1998 and Xtra International in 1999. Such consolidations obliged the newly formed leasing companies to retire a large number of old containers that were classified as uneconomic. As a result, for the past few years, the fall in the lessors' direct investment was minimized as the yearly disposal rate was maintained at around 300,000 TEU (see table 45). The fact that older containers were retired earlier through consolidations, and that the top five leasing companies controlled about 70 per cent of the leasing market share, the rental rates adjusted better to the changes in prices of new containers. This, in turn, helped to prevent the utilization rate of leased containers from falling too fast. 135. Retiring older containers through consolidations, however, did not entirely remove the problem of idle containers at low-demand areas. The companies with the largest stockpiles had to relocate their idle containers to areas with higher demand for export containers as this was cheaper in the long run than paying the mounting storage cost. 136. As mergers promote economies of scale that streamline performance within the industry, e-commerce also has contributed some degree of efficiency. Despite its young age, e-commerce has encouraged the birth of a new category of transport operators who own very few or not even a single container. Lessors are beginning to realize the growing importance of the role of e-commerce in marketing and servicing as part of their cost-saving strategies. The fundamental challenges for lessors may be 137. summarized as finding ways to meet the actual demand for leasing containers while generating profit near the break-even point and managing the reallocation of the growing mountains of idle boxes stranded at low demand locations around the world. Lessors agree that the answer to such challenges may begin with a substantial recovery of the market for leasing containers, in which an increase in demand for new boxes is generated by the growth of a more balanced world trade. Entering the year 2000, the industry faced the 138. lingering question of when the market would improve sufficiently to allow for a substantial return on their investment. Recent signs, however, supported a growing anticipation of the long awaited arrival of better market condition. The leasing companies, on the other hand, were hard to convince. Two years ago, similar signs had appeared showing a world market demand initially headed for improvement as containers' utilization rate increased to almost 85 per cent towards the beginning of 1998. The price of new containers also showed an improvement as it was expected to increase for two reasons: first, it was assumed that it had reached its lowest price level and, second, the Chinese Government had established a price floor for new containers in the first quarter of 1998.

Includes equipment leased to Cosco. 139. The 1998 signs turned out to be a disappointment as prices of new boxes fell further while the availability of low interest rates in the financial market continued. Such a combination sent carriers and other transport operators out on a buying spree for new boxes. The outcome was a sharp increase of lines' and other transport operators' holdings of new boxes as they purchased 31 per cent more than the previous year. Lessors, on the other hand, restricted their procurement behaviour, as in 1998 their direct investment had dropped almost 6 per cent to 755,000 TEU from the 800,000 TEU purchased a year earlier. 140. Moreover, the Asian financial crisis worsened the situation. Over the rest of 1998 and the first half of 1999, the procurement behaviour of both lines and lessors was curtailed heavily. In 1999, carriers and transport operators acquired only 5,000 TEU more than their 1998 purchases of 720,000 TEU, while lessors maintained their procurement level at about 9,000 TEU below their 1998 purchases of 755,000 TEU. The drop in demand for import and export 141. containers in and out of Russia and countries in Asia was so significant that it caused an unbalanced flow of

containers worldwide, which again put additional pressure on the off-hire boxes buildups that accounted for 25-30 per cent of available equipment for hire. The severity of the imbalance in the flow of trade worsened as the United States economy grew stronger. It caused the utilization rate to fall to a little above 80 per cent at the beginning of 1999; a 5 per cent drop from the level attained a year earlier as more than 1.2 million TEU were off-hired from the total available fleet of 5.8 million. At this point, the lease rates had fallen approximately 40 per cent over the past four years, which was proportional to the fall in new container prices over the same period. All of these factors thus contributed to the 15 per cent decrease in revenues for the container leasing industry between 1998 and 1999. 142. The crisis in Asia and Russia turned out to be short-lived. Starting in the third quarter of 1999, signs of recovery appeared. First of all, in addition to the improved flow of traded goods, prices of new containers started to increase, partly because of the higher cost of plywood flooring needed in the production of containers. Lines and transport operators responded by not buying as many new containers as the previous year; in other words, they acquired only 5,000 TEU more than the 720,000 TEU purchased a year earlier, and allocated more of their requirements to the leasing of additional boxes. An increase of interest rates in the United States and a temporary slowdown in the rate of containership deliveries also contributed to the change in the direct investment behaviour of carriers. The increase in leasing demand was reflected through the 2 per cent increase of average utilization rates due to the rehiring of idle containers. 143. In short, the stronger world demand for trade and the increase in prices of new containers strengthened the belief that the price increase will continue and contribute to a sustainable recovery of the leasing industry. If this recovery persists, lessors are likely to increase their procurement levels in 2000. Anticipation of recovery 144. However, lessors have yet to see a significant improvement in per diem lease rates. As the new box prices are on the rise, lessors hope for leasing rates to increase. 145. When carriers resorted to leasing to meet their demand for containers, they preferred to engage in a transaction that locked in low-priced deals for a three-to- five year period. This is possible with lessors placing their new containers on term lease. For lessors, the term lease is also favourable because, in the long run, its capital investment cost will be lower than average. By the end of 1999, the volume of rental fleets on term-lease contract had reached 50 per cent, while 35 per cent were tied to master-lease contract and the remaining 15 per cent were off-hired. Traditionally, master-lease option would have 146. earned 30 per cent more than those generated by term lease. Currently, however, the master-lease option has become less attractive because, in addition to its return being almost no different from the return generated by term lease, it would generate higher revenue only when the world demand for trade becomes much stronger and the stockpile of idle containers is substantially reduced. For now, the competitive term-lease contracts will continue to be the major source of income for the leasing industry. 147. Overall, in 2000, lessors are expected to continue their procurement strategy as the certainty of recovery grows. There is also a prospect for further mergers and management container as revenue and takeover, Container reallocation problems continue in 2000. replacement will remain an important task undertaken mostly by larger companies. The tendency to expand the fleet will remain part of strategies of mid- and smaller-sized companies to generate higher returns. the 148. The total leased fleet has grown by 7-8 per cent during the past two years and will continue to grow in the new millennium. In particular, leasing demand is likely to continue pushing for the expansion of the dry freight high cube container fleet. Table 46 shows that dry freight high cube has steadily expanded about 30 per cent every year for the past three years. The volume of dry freight special boxes, however, has increased slightly, suggesting that purchases made for this type of container were mainly for replacement. 149. Table 47, in addition, clearly shows that leasing demand for all sizes is growing except for the 48 ft containers. The demand for 20 foot, 40 foot, and 45 foot containers has increased by 14.16 per cent, 25.08 per cent, and 28.79 per cent, respectively.

Container production 150. At the beginning of 1999, the price of a new 20 ft standard container was less than $1,350 and the price of a new 40 ft standard container was a little over $2,100. As the lowest in more than two decades, the 1999 container prices were also 45 per cent lower than the prices quoted four years earlier. Toward mid-1999, however, the prices started to increase and, by the third and fourth quarters, the prices of new boxes were 2-3 per cent and 5 per cent higher than the prices quoted at the start of 1999, respectively. The increase in the 1999 prices of new boxes absorbed the 50 per cent increase in the cost of Indonesian plywood for box flooring. 151. China remained the major supplier of new boxes representing 66 per cent of the global dry freight container production (see table 48). Because most of the manufacturers were located in the central and southern areas of China, where resources and raw material were relatively cheaper, China was able to produce boxes at very competitive prices dictating the world price of new containers. 152. At the end of 1999, the price of new 20 ft containers was about $1,460-1,480 across China. This increase in the price of new containers was reportedly welcomed by the industry as an inevitable result of the recovery from the Asian financial crisis, and should the price continue to increase, it would help producers in their cost-saving effort to generate revenue for the industry. An early reaction to the price hike was the setting of prices by container producers with their larger customers on volume production for the year 2000. The fall in container output in 1999, which had 153. initially been predicted to be 10 per cent, actually stood at a 2 per cent drop (see graph 9). The reason for the output not to drop any more than 2 per cent was the increase in demand for new containers that originated from the stronger world demand for trade following the end of the Asian crisis, and from the streamlining of the industry that went through continuing consolidations, which ensured a more efficient production of new boxes. In other words, with the improvement in the terms of trade and the speedy recovery from the Asian financial crisis, the increasing demand for new boxes was expected to continue or remain at current levels, sustaining an increase in the price of new containers. 154. The composition of production in 2000 is also expected to follow the trend from the past couple of years. As shown in table 49, total production was dominated by the demand for dry containers totalling about 1.2 million TEUs. Dry freight containers produced in 1999 and 1998 constituted about 84 per cent of the global production. The other types of boxes, comprising 11.7 per cent of world box production, had changed in composition. In particular, the production of tank and special boxes fell by 25 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, productions of swapbodies increased by more than 20 per cent.

B. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE AND ITS IMPACT ON TRANSPORT Tracking movements of shipments along transport chain. the 84 The emerging role of Internet-based transportation service providers 155. Major transport companies, including maritime carriers, are now providing a variety of information about their services on the Internet as well as enabling customers to process transactions online. In addition, in recent years there has been a considerable growth of infomediaries, which are creating marketplaces, and exchanges for transportation services. This section provides a brief description and selected examples of such infomediaries or Internet transport portals. Internet 156. are websites transport portals that are designed to bring together large numbers of transportation service buyers and sellers and thus match their offers and requirements. They function in the same way as more general web portals such as Yahoo, Excite, Infoseek, etc., except that they specialize in enabling the search for information on, and carrying of transactions in, transport. The following are examples of online capabilities 157. that they provide: Shippers posting their requirements for tonnage, rates, delivery time and other conditions; Carriers posting their available capacity, rates, routing, delivery time and other conditions; Shippers viewing rates and information on capacity available from carriers; Shippers responding to offers of capacity, delivery time and rates set by carriers; Carriers responding to loads offered by shippers at carriers' posted rates; Carriers and shippers making contracts based on mutually agreed offers; Printing and receiving bills of lading; Cargo booking and confirmation; Cargo notification; Payment; 158. Box 2 gives selected example of Internet transport portals. They demonstrate the range of services being offered and the ways in which they affect the activities of carriers and intermediaries. While there is a high degree of similarity or overlap between the services being offered by the different Internet portals, there are at the same time important variations as regards their scope and the objectives they pursue.13 159. A number of features can be summarized from the examples outlined in Box 2. Many of the services are designed for accessing by carriers, intermediaries and shippers. In such cases, in theory, the systems should benefit all the three groups. Some of the services are intended to arrange direct transactions between carriers and shippers and to bypass intermediaries. To the extent that the services do indeed bypass the intermediaries, the net effect would be to reduce their participation in the transportation chain. far as forwarders and other intermediaries can, in practice, have the same access as shippers to the services concerned, there appears to be no mechanism for them to be excluded. However, so in 160. A few service providers, such as FreightDesk, are dedicated to transportation intermediaries and the shippers they serve. Such services would enhance the role of intermediaries rather that diminish it. The argument advanced by the developers of FreightDesk is that intermediaries will always be needed because they have trading knowledge that carriers and shippers lack. This may be the case in most existing business-to-business transactions in which the professional expertise of intermediaries may be required to organize shipments. 161. Intermediaries may offer a number of advantages which may ensure continued demand for them. The main attraction in using intermediaries, such as forwarders, lies in their experience and specialized knowledge of a wide range of matters regarding transportation, packing, formalities related to letters of credit, customs, import licenses, etc.

Box 2 Selected examples of Internet-based transportation service providers TRADIANT Tradiant offers a business-to-business market exchange for freight transportation services that brings together carriers, shippers and freight forwarders. It enables carriers and shippers to participate in a global online market for containerised cargo. On Tradiant's website, shippers or forwarders can request rate quotes for one-time shipments and also for contracts for periodic shipments over time. On the other hand, carriers can provide quotes in response to requests initiated by shippers. When requesting quotes, shippers or forwarders can specify a price and also choose to send a request to all carriers, carriers of a certain type or class, or named carriers. Having received quotes, a shipper may then accept or act on a quote accordingly. In addition to enabling the request and offer process, Tradiant facilitates the handling of actual transactions between carriers and shippers. This includes the establishment of a physical contract, online cargo booking, documentation, shipment control and payment across all modes of transport. According to Tradiant, its system helps small to medium-sized forwarders by providing them with a state- of-the-art technology platform that is normally available to freight forwarders with large technology budgets. It enables forwarders to manage a large number of quotes and contracts from many shippers in a short time and at relatively low cost. Tradiant's services are free for shippers. It charges the carriers a transaction fee for each quote or offer that results in a booking. iShip iShip provides an Internet-based shipping service that allows shippers and carriers to make shipping transactions online. Its focus is mainly on small-sized shipments. It allows users of shipping services to access and compare rates and services that are provided by major integrated carriers, such as UPS, FedEx, Airborne, U.S. Postal Services, Yellow Freight System, etc. It provides answers to basic shipping questions, such as the cost of shipment by alternative carriers, delivery times, by weight and destination, etc. Users of shipping services can obtain information on a range of providers of shipping services. They can also get access to shipment tracking tools and secure data for billing purposes. Online vendors can add shipping features to their website by linking to the appropriate iShip.com URLs and thus provide buyers with information on shipping prices and options. iShip also gives buyers of shipping services the possibility of bidding for rates. It assembles information from sellers of shipping services which is then matched with preferences expressed by users of the services. The bidding is completed by iShip providing a matrix of shipping rates for various carriers selected by the user. GoCargo GoCargo is a web-based auction for transport services. It is independent, without any affiliation with shippers or service providers. Through its Internet website, it provides access to shippers of all sizes to receive multiple competing bids from service providers in an auction format. By viewing and evaluating alternative options that match their needs, shippers are able to select services. For service providers, GoCargo receives information on cargo opportunities that match the provider's profile. National Transportation Exchange (NTE) The NTE is a United States national business-to-business e-commerce trading exchange for member shippers and truck carriers. It is used by shippers, forwarders, brokers, third party logistics intermediaries and truckload freight carriers. It creates a transportation- trading marketplace by providing shared information on shipment time, transport availability, prices, routing and service levels.14 NTE has around 500 industry user members. Users of truck transport looking for truck capacity service post their requirements on the Exchange and these are matched with available carriers' capacity. Carriers use the Exchange to find compatible freight that would fill out empty space on their trucks. The Exchange determines minimum, market-based prices on every shipment entered and consignors can enter freight at any price at or above the set minimum. Shipments quoted at lower than the minimum are not accepted. The Exchange also provides users with up-to-date information on the movement of shipments.

Celarix Celarix is a provider of a web-based transport exchange that combines the ability to buy and sell transportation services and also to manage and monitor the entire logistics process. Through the exchange, information is provided from sellers, carriers, customs brokers, freight forwarders and consolidators (NVCCs). Shippers can buy transportation services online. They can instantly communicate their requirements to many service providers, while service providers can offer available shipping space to the entire marketplace or selected users. Negotiations are thus permitted, leading to the securing of transportation service contracts and online cargo booking and confirmation.15 FreightDesk This is an online transportation service provider dedicated to transportation intermediaries and the shippers served by the intermediaries. It is not an online auction but deals with managing logistics processes from the standpoint of freight forwarders, customs brokers, NVOCCs and their customers. The founders of FreightDesk take the view that forwarders and other intermediaries will always be needed on the transportation chain because they have "the domain knowledge of trading that carriers and shippers intrinsically lack". They contend that freight forwarders should not have to face extinction because of the new market in online transportation auctions through which shippers of any size theoretically can buy their transportation directly from carriers. The intermediary is a domain expert which cannot be replaced by software. The complexity of international trading means that there is a need for middlemen.16 The approach of FreightDesk is to use Internet-based communications capabilities to give forwarders a range of up-to-date tools that make them more effective and attractive to shippers and more economically viable. Such tools also enable small and medium-sized freight forwarders to survive alongside much bigger intermediaries. Thus unlike some other service providers, FreightDesk develops a partnership with freight intermediaries instead of trying to bypass them in the transportation chain. Carrierpoint Carrierpoint is an online transportation market that allows shippers and carriers to offer shipments, communicate prices and share information. Its founders aim at permitting carriers and shippers to create a true market environment free of middlemen or hidden charges. Shippers post available shipments on the marketplace and then matching carriers are notified, upon which they can communicate their current market prices. The carriers' prices are then communicated to the posting shippers along with each carrier's service characteristics. The shipper uses this information to select the best carrier for their posted shipments.17 The providers of CarrierPoint point out that their service is not an auction. Shippers are not required to accept the lowest bid. Both the shippers and carriers can set bid terms and reserves are not binding. Also postings can be discriminatory in that shippers can specify who will see their shipments. Tranzlink Tranzlink is an electronic marketplace for freight transportation transactions for truckload shippers, brokers and carriers in North America. Participants in the trading system can match loads, negotiate contracts and confirm pick-ups and delivery details online. The system provides a dual-track capability, that is broker/carrier and shipper/carrier trading environments.18 Through the Internet, shippers post available loads showing pick-up date, origin, destination, type of equipment needed, type of commodity, estimated target price and other additional information. Carriers can accept a job as posted or bid online along with other carriers, until an arrangement is agreed upon between the shipper and a carrier. Similarly, carriers post details of available equipment, including locations and desired destinations. Shippers, brokers and logistics companies can view these and enter competitive bids. When a bid is accepted a confirmation containing essential details such as costs, delivery times and cargo weight is sent to the shipper. E-Transport E-Transport is a marketplace where buyers and sellers of transportation services can conduct transactions electronically. It is designed to connect all trading partners including shippers, carriers and transportation intermediaries and ports. Users of transportation services can check tariff rates for shipping specific commodities from origin to destination. Through the marketplace shippers and carriers can negotiate rates and service contracts. They can use E-Transport's browser tools to enter shipment details, book cargo, generate documentation, rate and audit bills and track shipments.19

importantly, though, many freight 162. More forwarders have now expanded the scope of their services to become door-to-door logistics providers. Thus, while an individual shipper may search the required information on the Internet, the range of services that a forwarder can offer creates a value added service which shippers are prepared to continue to buy from forwarders. Also experience gained so far indicates that the rapid growth of e-commerce is placing heavy demands on e-retailers in fulfilling orders. In many cases such retailers lack the necessary logistics networks needed to meet the requirements of buyers. There has therefore been a tendency for them to outsource services from third party logistics providers, including forwarders. The emerging services provide the intermediaries with tools for improving their efficiency and access to shippers. Thus, rather than being bypassed their positions may be strengthened. Internet-based transportation Other related impacts of Internet transport portals 163. Increased competition between carriers: The growth of Internet transport portals and related exchanges, auctions and other market mechanisms are likely to intensify competition between carriers in the supply of transportation services. Even though carriers of all sizes would have access to cargoes through the Internet, the competition is likely to drive out small carriers from the industry. This in turn would encourage higher degrees of concentration in the industry in the form of domination by large integrators or carriers operating in large consortia or global alliances. However, even cooperation arrangements such as global alliances are likely to be unstable due to the intra-alliance competition that would be encouraged by transport exchanges, auctions, etc. In the long run, this scenario may favour the domination of freight markets by large individual carriers integrators and other "protected" from competition via vertical integration or mergers. large Pricing in liner conference services: The 164. growth of transport exchanges and auctions provide opportunities for direct contact between carriers and shippers and thus greater partnership between them. This would lead to further reduction of the already diminishing role of liner conferences in influencing the pricing of services. There will be greater reliance on confidential price negotiations and contracts between shippers and individual lines. In some major trades individual contracts already account for the majority of liner shipments. 165. An empirical assessment of the real impact of web transport portals is generally hard to make, however. There are no consistent data or information on the overall volume of transport services that are traded on the portals. This problem is likely to persist if carriers and shippers place emphasis on confidentiality, for example with regard to rates. In addition to the data problem, there is a 166. perception in the industry that carriers may be uncertain as regards the the transactions that may be carried out on the portals. For example carriers could fear that posting rates on a portal by a number of them could be interpreted as price fixing by collusive means in contravention of certain antitrust laws. legal position of The position of developing countries 167. The majority of Internet transport portals that have been established so far are located in developed countries. However, the services they provide are, in principle, accessible to carriers and shippers around the world, including developing countries. Thus, in as far as trade access is concerned, buyers and sellers of transport services in developing countries are not disadvantaged by the geographical location of the portals. Indeed for e-commerce generally, there is evidence that some e-retailers in developing countries prefer to market their products on websites located in developed countries where the markets are larger, payment mechanisms are suitable and the degree of sellers' and buyer's confidence is higher. 168. On the other hand, however, the location in developing countries of Internet portals, including those for transport services, would benefit developing countries in the form of service revenues and also greater control of overall website operations for the services provided. C. EXPERT MEETING ON CAPACITY- BUILDING IN THE AREA OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE: LEGAL AND REGULATORY DIMENSIONS In order to assess the policies the potential 169. impact developing countries of the legal and regulatory proposals currently being discussed in international forums and to be considered by developing countries and the international community to stimulate the participation of smaller players in global electronic commerce,20 an Expert Meeting on Legal Dimensions of Electronic Commerce was convened under UNCTAD auspices in Geneva in July

88 1999. The Expert Meeting, having acknowledged that most of the existing rules and legislation would in general also apply to electronic commerce, expressed concern that the existing paper-based legal systems might be insufficient to accommodate electronic commerce and might create uncertainty. In particular, the requirements in national laws for written, signed or original documents to were as the development of electronic commerce. The importance of establishing an internationally acceptable harmonized legal framework for electronic signatures and authentication was particularly highlighted by the Experts. the following specific concerns21 of developing countries were singled out: the Meeting constituting considered During barriers neutral and permit their interpretation and application in an electronic environment. In legal reviewing 171. infrastructures, their Governments are encouraged to give consideration to using the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce, as well as other instruments on electronic commerce prepared by UNCITRAL and other organizations, as a basis for preparing new laws or adjusting current laws. Where appropriate, Governments should also consider the introduction of rules to give certainty with regard to the legal effect of using specific technologies within a technologically neutral legal infrastructure. The lack of internationally acceptable rules and guidelines for the recognition of electronic signatures, digital signatures and certification authorities; Restrictions imposed on the export of technology, especially with respect to state-of-the-art encryption standards; The need for an international scheme for registration of domain names; Problems arising from the application of traditional principles on jurisdiction and applicable law in an electronic environment; The need for wider dissemination of information on international developments pertaining to the legal and regulatory aspects of electronic commerce, as well as a need for training and education, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises; The need for technical assistance to developing countries, and particularly the least developed countries (LDCs), in adapting their national law to accommodate electronic commerce. 170. To address some of those concerns, the Expert Meeting adopted a number of recommendations22 addressed to national Governments, to the international community as well as to UNCTAD. The following reflect some of the recommendations adopted at the Expert Meeting: To examine the existing national legal infrastructure to assess if paper-based form requirements prevent laws from being applied to electronic transactions and to determine whether such form requirements should be adjusted to make their laws technology- 172. Developed country Governments are urged to dismantle barriers to global electronic commerce for developing countries by removing restrictions on the export of technology, especially with respect to state-of- the-art encryption systems and products, as well as associated technologies and computer systems. 173. Governments of developed and developing countries, especially those that are members of regional economic groupings, are encouraged to establish cooperative relationships so as to increase their capacity to deal with the complexity of the issues that have arisen due and communication technologies in such areas as taxation, customs, intellectual property, domain names, computer crime, Internet content regulation, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, certification authorities, and the role of accreditation and standardization bodies. the development of information to 174. Governments of developing countries are encouraged to participate in the preparation of various legal instruments being considered in international forums and to promote public awareness and education of all aspects of electronic commerce and the opportunities and benefits it offers. Finally, the international community is requested 175. to provide assistance to developing countries in reviewing and adapting their national laws to accommodate electronic commerce, promoting awareness, education and training in the legal and regulatory aspects affecting electronic commerce. 176.

D. OTHER DEVELOPMENTS Latin America and the Caribbean 90 for training locally-managed The TRAINMAR programme provides a system 177. for shore-based professionals in the fields of international transport, port management, and logistics, with a view to improve maritime trade. It ensures, through continuous and flexible cooperation among Training Centres, that a wide range of training is available effectively and economically. Each cooperating centre joins a regional network, maintaining regular contact with other centres; the regional networks also remain in contact and all are linked to a Central Support Team (CST) at UNCTAD's headquarters in Geneva. Efforts and resources are shared and each member has access to the latest information, experience and products. The training that results is organized and conducted professionally by local staff trained in the TRAINMAR approach, and is shaped to meet the needs of the community. Trainers who have gained experience through TRAINMAR have been able to conduct wider training in other countries, and in topics not considered to be the domain of UNCTAD, such as portworker training using materials prepared by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and increasingly implemented through TRAINMAR. Asia/Pacific Region In this region, TRAINMAR is currently active in 178. Egypt, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Members meet periodically to prepare plans for joint actions, which in 1999 have included a regional system of quality control applied to new courses being developed, and with help from the CST at members' request, the initiation of two projects to bring technology-based training methods into regular use for meeting the demands of an increasingly privatized maritime trade sector. 179. New interest has been expressed during 1999 from institutes in countries not currently involved with TRAINMAR, notably in Western Asia but also in Nepal, the first landlocked country of the region to recognise the benefits offered by network membership, and Australia where there is a willingness to help as well as share with centres in other countries. Greater membership in Western Asia may lead to the creation of a separate network there. Also, following contacts with countries of the Pacific, a project proposal has been prepared to support the creation of a separate TRAINMAR network. in The TRAINMAR network has been very active in 180. the Latin America and Caribbean region thanks to the more than 20 associate members, gathered in three regional networks (Southern Cone, Central America and Caribbean Basin). Faced with changing structures, partners and clients the maritime business, TRAINMAR capacities had to be adapted to reflect new training demands, which include transport logistics, information quality technology and the concept of port community services. To meet these new challenges, new products and services have been developed over the past year, to the growing satisfaction of the wider port, transport and shipping communities served by TRAINMAR. environmental aspects, and In South America, the TRAINMAR South 181. American Association (ATAS), a non-profit private organization was created in 1996 to enhance the coordination of the regional TRAINMAR activities and better represent the interests and objectives of the TRAINMAR members in South America. Since that date, the association, jointly supported by UNCTAD and the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), has developed an important number of new training materials and additional services to training. 182. In Central America, TRAINMAR has been working hand in hand since 1987 with COCATRAM, the Central American Commission for Maritime Transport. National port authorities or responsible commissions in each of the six countries of the Central American isthmus, excluding Panama, have been implementing TRAINMAR through their respective training or human resources sections. After privatization of port activities touched Panama, TRAINMAR activities have been coordinated there by the Panama Maritime Authority. Strong and long-lasting horizontal cooperation mechanisms among members allow for an intensive annual work programme, with more than 80 per cent of the courses being port centered. 183. The Caribbean Basin network is a successful combination of public and private port companies, universities and non-profit organizations working towards the goal of providing high quality training services, in three languages, with a strong emphasis on the transport logistics sector. A diploma programme in The Logistics International Transport of Goods has been of in and successfully implemented developed

Contrary to most TRAINMAR network members around the world, each Caribbean network member course development, multimedia development, course delivery, consulting, etc. To accelerate its integration as an efficient training provider, the Caribbean Basin network decided in 1998 to standardize all its working procedures in order to obtain a quality certification following ISO 9002 quality standard. in one activity: delivered for the benefit of the local port and shipping community, as well as future TRAINMAR course developers. In Georgia, traditional TRAINMAR and IPP (Improving Port Performance) courses are being translated into Russian with a view to a wider use in Russian speaking countries. In both countries, TRAINMAR is cooperating with the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) in the framework of port modernization technical assistance projects. Other regions In Eastern Europe, TRAINMAR has established 184. two centres in Constanza, Romania, and Batumi, Georgia, with the hope of creating a regional network by the Black Sea. So far, the training needs analysis has been completed in both countries, and training plans are being prepared for 2000. In Romania, 8 courses were 185. In Africa, cooperation between centres is being reactivated after a period without structured cooperation among the various qualified centres still active individually. In March 2000, trainers or managers from Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Gabon, The Gambia, Guinea, Senegal, Togo and the United Republic of Tanzania met in Las Palmas, Canary Islands, where UNCTAD was requested to support renewed cooperation among the interested countries.

Chapter VII REVIEW OF REGIONAL DEVELOPMENTS: SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA This chapter reviews and analyses the global and intraregional trades in sub-Saharan Africa, along with developments in transport and related services. A. ECONOMIC BACKGROUND (a) General situation held at low-to-moderate single-digit levels. This relatively strong performance can be attributed in part to continued appropriate macroeconomic policies. 186. The economies of sub-Saharan Africa have recently been influenced by three main developments. The first were movements in commodity prices. The persistent weakness of non-oil commodity prices continues to constrain growth in many countries in sub- Saharan Africa. Secondly, pressures for structural reforms have increased, in some cases because of the economic difficulties brought on by depressed commodity prices in recent years. Thus, increased attention has been given by Governments the for transportation privatization of public utility and companies in many of the sub-Saharan African countries, in order to improve the business and investment environment. Thirdly, the economic outlook is also being shaped by various improvements in trade and political cooperation. Several positive developments have been cited, including the implementation of the common external tariff by the West African Economic and Monetary Union, and plans for establishing free-trade areas in the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa and also in the Southern African Development Community in 2000. to preparations 187. For sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, growth in economic activities, measured by GDP, has been projected to grow by around 3 per cent in 1999 and 5 per cent in 2000. This aggregate figure masks the fact that some countries such as Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Sudan, United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda have been performing relatively well in macroeconomic terms. Growth of 4.0-5.5 per cent was projected for most of these countries in 1999, with further strengthening expected in 2000, and inflation has in general been (b) Macroeconomic performances Real GDP 188. The GDP growth of sub-Saharan Africa was stagnant for the period from 1991 through 1994, compared to the average annual growth of 2.3 per cent for the 1981-1990 period. Their overall economic activities regained some momentum in 1995, and sustained this positive development until 1998, when the growth rate fell below 3.0 per cent, and was also less than 3.0 per cent in 1999. A similar trend is observed in the GDP growth rate fluctuation of developed market-economy countries. This reflects how sub-Saharan African countries' economic performance as a whole has been closely related to those of the advanced economies. However, the trend in sub-Saharan Africa was in sharp contrast with that of all developing countries, specifically Asian developing countries, until the end of 1997. In 1998, the Asian economic and financial crisis adversely affected the overall economic performance of all country groups, including sub-Saharan developing countries. In 1999 all groups, including the sub-Saharan group, seem to be recovering gradually from the economic and financial slowdown (see table 50). 189. In West Africa, the economies of this subregion have continued to develop favourably since 1995, after a number of countries went through a phase of negative growth in previous years. In 1998, despite the Asian crisis, countries in this subregion generally performed well, recording positive growth rates which had been above the average rate of sub-Saharan Africa, with the

96 exception of Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone and Togo. The economy of Sierra Leone had fluctuated drastically since 1990. Nigeria, the most influential economy in this subregion, saw its economic growth fall below 2.0 per cent in 1998, adversely affected by the drop in oil exports mainly as a result of the Asian crisis. 190. In the Central African subregion, most countries have maintained a relatively reasonable course of growth since 1995, with an exception of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which continued to contribute negatively to the overall GDP growth of the subregion. The performance of the three oil exporters in the subregion has been generally stable since 1995. Cameroon recovered in 1995 from a prolonged depression in the oil sector as well as in the agricultural sector. The economic performance of both the Republic of the Congo and Gabon has been strong since 1995 thanks to higher oil production until 1997, which declined by 3-5 per cent in both countries in 1998. This has resulted in lower rates of growth. In Eastern and Southern Africa, Zambia's GDP 191. continued to experience wide fluctuations between negative and positive growth rates since 1990, despite the Government's wide-ranging reform programme. Angola, the largest oil-producer in the subregion, recovered, after a sharp decline in 1993 in economic activities, until 1998 when it had a small negative growth rate mainly due to the slowdown in the non-oil industry. Zimbabwe has been experiencing fluctuations of positive GDP growth except in 1992 and 1995. Kenya registered higher growth in 1995 and 1996 as strict budgetary management resulted in improvements in the financial situation, although since 1997 a decline in the growth rate has been observed. GDP growth in the United Republic of Tanzania has been relatively stable since the early 1990s. Mozambique has had very positive results since 1992. (c) Total trade in goods Table 51 compares developments of annual 192. trades in goods of sub-Saharan Africa with those of all developing countries. In the sub-Saharan African developing countries, the unfavourable developments of both exports and in value and volume respectively over the period from 1991 through 1993 corresponded to the low growth in GDP of developed market-economy countries. On the other hand, favourable trade expansion of all developing countries for the same period was largely attributed to the increased intraregional trades of East and South-East Asia. imports Table 51 Total trade in goods of sub-Saharan Africa and developing countries (annual percentage change 1981-1999) Average 1981-1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 Sub-Saharan Africa Developing countries Value Export -1.2 -4.3 -0.1 -5.0 4.6 18.5 10.8 1.5 -13.9 Import -1.1 1.4 5.2 -3.2 2.9 21.5 Volume Export 0.5 2.2 Import -0.5 1.9 Value Export 0.8 0.8 0.9 3.3 7.7 0.9 0.8 3.1 9.2 2.9 12.8 4.6 15.3 23.1 Import 2.7 9.6 13.9 9.4 9.8 20.6 4.3 9.2 8.4 9.5 8.1 5.4 -3.3 5.4 -0.7 8.1 1.7 8.2 -7.2 6.7 -5.3 Volume Export 2.5 6.3 10.1 8.5 12.9 14.7 5.8 12.4 4.6 Import 1.9 7.7 14.5 10.5 8.3 14.4 7.0 10.4 -1.3 3.0 3.7 2.5 3.3 3.9 2.6 2.4 2.0 Source: IMF, World Economic Outlook, October 1999

97 193. Over the period from 1995 through 1999, the exports of sub-Saharan African countries increased at an average annual rate of 4.0 per cent in value and 5.1 per cent in volume, with imports increasing at 6.3 per cent per year in value and 6.9 per cent in volume. Over the same period, the exports of all developing countries expanded at an average annual growth rate of 7.5 per cent in value and 8.0 per cent in volume, while imports also increased at 6.5 per cent in value as well as in volume. In 1998, growth of trades (exports and imports) of sub-Saharan African countries as well as all developing countries fell drastically to a negative level, while those of the previous three years (1995-1997) represented an average growth rate of 10-14 per cent per year. This particular decline in growth is largely attributable to the adverse effects of the Asian crisis. B. GENERAL SITUATION OF MERCHANT FLEETS OF AFRICA Merchant fleets in sub-Saharan African countries Table 52 provides data on 194. the overall development of the merchant fleets of the world and sub- Saharan African countries by principal types of ship. Total tonnage of all the sub-Saharan African countries decreased from 0.29 per cent of the world total in 1980 to 0.23 per cent in 1990 and reached 0.15 per cent in 1999. Tankers and general cargo ships account for 46.4 per cent and 29.1 per cent respectively of the total sub- Saharan fleets. Tanker tonnage increased very slowly but steadily from 459,000 dwt in 1980 to 561,000 dwt in 1999, whilst total tonnage of general cargo ships has been shrinking constantly from 1.4 million dwt in 1980 to 0.8 million dwt in 1990, and further down to 0.35 million dwt in 1999. Dry bulker tonnage increased to 74,000 dwt in 1999 from 20,000 dwt in the previous year, which only accounted for a minimal portion of the world dry bulker fleet. No containerships were registered in this subregion. West Africa shares 75.6 per cent of the total tonnage of this subregion, standing at 0.9 million dwt in 1999 as compared with 1.3 million dwt in 1980 and 1.1 million dwt in 1990. While West Africa's tankers almost doubled the tonnage in 1980 to 535,000 dwt in 1999, general cargo ships in deadweight tons have plummeted from 966,000 dwt in 1980 to only 137,000 dwt in 1999. The merchant fleet of East Africa makes up 15.0 per cent of the total sub-Saharan fleet, representing 182,000 dwt, which remain unchanged from the tonnage in 1980, albeit with large year-to-year fluctuations since then. The majority of this area's fleet is made up of general cargo ships, the tonnage of which remained unchanged since the early 1990s in 1999 (148,000 dwt in 1980 and 91,000 dwt in 1985). Total tonnage of Central Africa and Southern Africa has been steadily declining, reaching 18,000 dwt and 95,000 dwt respectively in 1999. representing 147,000 dwt Merchant fleets of the world and those registered in sub-Saharan African countries, selected years (in thousand dwt) Table 52 Year Total Tanker Dry bulker General cargo Container Others World total 1980 682 768 339 324 185 652 115 824 11 243 30 725 1985 664 800 261 439 232 107 105 846 19 939 45 469 1990 658 377 245 936 234 659 102 676 25 955 49 151 1995 734 917 267 650 261 628 104 129 43 849 57 660 1998 788 725 280 668 275 514 103 388 61 183 67 972 1999 798 995 283 617 276 072 103 862 63 669 71 776

99 C. MOVEMENTS OF NON-LINER DRY CARGO AND MAJOR DRY BULK CARGO 195. Table 53 indicates movements of all non-liner dry cargo and major dry bulk cargo (coal, iron ore and grain) to and from the subregions of sub-Saharan Africa. Subregional analysis of exports shows that all non-liner dry cargoes have been expanding at the average annual growth rate of 3-4 per cent over the past several years. About 75 per cent of the total is exported from the southern coast. Imports have increased at the rate of 2- 3 per cent yearly. Nearly 60 per cent of total imports were moved through the West coast of sub-Saharan Africa. The southern coast followed with about 30 per cent of total imports. For the major commodities, the iron ore export shipments originated from the southern and western coasts. South Africa exported about two-thirds of the total iron ore exports, and Liberia exported the majority of the western coast shipments. The coal exports from the southern coast, which were dominated by South Africa, continued to show an upward trend, representing about 55 million tons in 1999. For grain imports, the trade is shared by the western coast, the eastern coast and the southern coast at 50, 20 and 30 per cent respectively. The United States has been the biggest grain supplier to all the sub-Saharan African subregions, acounting for more than half of the total imports of the region, followed by Northern Europe. Age distribution of the merchant fleet 196. Table 54 provides data on the age distri- bution of the merchant fleet of developing countries or in ship (14.09 years) to be older differences individual of Africa by types of vessel as at the beginning of 2000. The average age of African developing countries' than fleets (19.47 years) continued the world average the developing countries' average (13.75 years). The share of vessels aged 15 years and over stands at 82.7 per cent as compared with 49.3 per cent for the world total and 46.9 per cent for the developing countries' total. Similar distribution large age types, except for are observed in the average age of containerships, which was 10.79 years as compared with 9.72 years and 9.16 years for the world total and the developing countries, respectively. The tankers and general cargo combined tonnage of shipsregistered in African countries accounted for 53 per cent of the total African fleet. The average age stood at of tankers and general cargo 21.80 years and 20.71 years. tonnage aged 15 years and over represents 98.8 per cent for tankers and 90.2 per cent for general cargo ships. The tanker tonnage of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Nigeria and Egypt make up 34, 33 and 23 per cent (90 per cent in total) of the African these three countries' tanker tonnage reached nearly 22 years. The tanker tonnage aged 15 years and over of these countries represents over 98 per cent. Egypt and Algeria share 34 per cent and 18 per cent respectively of the total African general cargo ship fleet. The average age of general cargo ships registered in these two countries are 20.17 years and 21.63 years respectively.

104 D. MOVEMENTS OF CRUDE OIL AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS 197 Crude oil and petroleum products movements of sub-Saharan Africa are shown in table 55. Crude oil shipments from the West coast represented more than two-thirds of the total, and were mainly exported by Nigeria in West Africa, and the other smaller producers such as Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabon in Central Africa. Angola, the second largest oil producing country in sub-Saharan Africa, exported nearly one-fifth of the region's total, dominating the crude oil shipments from the southern coast. By destination of crude oil shipments, nearly half the total was destined for the United States, followed by Northern Europe (a share of nearly a quarter) and Southern Europe (about 10 per cent). Exports of petroleum products, the majority of which are fuels for the United States, were dominated by the West coast (Nigeria), with more than 90 per cent of the total quantity shipped. Imports of petroleum products, which were mainly supplied equally by Northern and Southern Europe, moved through the West coast, and represented nearly 80 per cent of the total imports. E. LINER CARGO MOVEMENTS 198. Table 56 shows movements of containerized liner cargo from 1998 to 2000 between the sub-Saharan African countries (including South Africa) and the three major trading partners (North America, Asia and Europe). Total traffic of both imports (54 per cent) and exports (46 per cent) have increased at an average annual rate of 2.1 per cent (imports at 0.8 per cent and exports at 3.6 per cent) from 2.0 million TEUs in 1998 to nearly 2.1 million TEUs in 2000, of which approximately half are loaded or discharged on the Southern coast. About two-thirds of the volume through the Southern coast are traded by South Africa. The West coast accounts for about one-third of the total trade volume. 199. In terms of trade partners, trades with Europe, the most important trade partner, have increased at an average annual rate of 2.3 per cent, reaching nearly 60 per cent of the total trade in 2000. The average shares of European trade generated by the western, eastern and southern African subregions were at 44 per cent, 13 per cent and 43 per cent respectively and also represented 70 per cent, 60 per cent and 50 per cent of the total trade transacted by each of the three subregions for the period from 1998 to 2000. For Europe, the import and export ratio was 53 to 47. Trades with North America have been growing slowly (2.0 per cent yearly). The total volume traded in 1998 amounted to 227,000 TEUs, and is estimated to reach 236,000 TEUs in 2000 or 11.4 per cent of the total trade. The regional distribution of North American trade among the West, East and Southern coasts was 30, 10 and 60 per cent respectively, and the ratio between imports and exports was 56 to 44. The trade with Japan, the Far Eastern NIEs and South-East Asia was nearly one-fifth of the total trade, but its share has declined since 1998. The ratio between import and export boxes was almost even, and two-thirds of this trade are with southern Africa (mainly South Africa).

108 F. COSTS OF TRANSPORT IN AFRICAN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (a) Cost factor for import trades 200. Table 57 provides estimates of total freight payments for imports and the freight costs as a percentage of total import value by country groups. For sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa), freight costs a percentage of total import value were five percentage points higher than the average for all developing countries. Freight costs of landlocked African developing countries were 10 percentage points higher than the total developing countries' average. In 31 out of the 43 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, freight costs on imports were 50 per cent higher than the average for all developing countries, and for 13 of those countries the costs were more than double.

(b) Comparison of transit and ocean freight costs of imports to selected African land-locked countries 201. A comparison between ocean freight charges paid for containerized imports and inland transit costs shows the relative importance of the inland costs. The difference was very significant with the land-transport rate factor varying between 1 and 4, suggesting tha t the biggest potential for reducing total transport costs for imports and exports of landlocked developing countries would be to reduce the level of costs for the inland transit operations (see table 58). These operations, conducted between the port area and the destination/originating area, included other services such as handling at terminals, warehouses and inland depots, storage, security for avoiding loss by pilferage of goods and return of containers on time to avoid demurrage.

110 (c) Freight costs in selected landlocked countries in Africa 202. Landlocked developing countries in Africa continued to suffer from excessive transport costs. High import transport costs inflated the consumer prices of imported goods, and high transport costs for exports undermined their competitiveness in foreign markets. International transport costs are defined as the direct and indirect costs which are incidental to the transportation of goods from their point of loading to their destinations. The major elements accounting for the high freight costs for landlocked developing countries included inefficient transport facilities and their management, imbalanced trades, inadequate overall infrastructure, and inefficient or cumbersome government regulations (see table 59).

111 G. IMPROVING TRANSPORT OPERATIONS AND SERVICES THROUGH ACIS 203. As a response to high transport costs and low operational efficiency on African transport routes, the UNCTAD secretariat has developed the Advance Cargo Information System (ACIS), an IT-based tracking system designed to improve transport operations and services to customers. ACIS gives information on cargo in advance of its arrival across different modes and interfaces. By making appropriate information available, ACIS allows the effective logistics management of a transport chain. It is composed of a railway system called RailTracker, PortTracker for ports, LakeTracker for lakes, and RoadTracker which is still under development. 204. RailTracker is a computerized wagon, loco- motive and train reporting system that tracks cargo and wagons throughout their movement. It thus increases the efficiency of freight operations, enabling railways to plan the movement of wagons much more effectively by always knowing where the wagons are, and whether they are fit for running, empty or loaded. This improves the short-term train planning by providing information on when empties will be available. In addition, based on up- to-date records of usage of equipment, it enhances the planning of maintenance of rolling stock and loco- motives. RailTracker also enables the railways to satisfy customer's requests for information about the where- abouts of their goods at any given time and generates statistics and performance indicators for decision making. (iii) Average daily interchange balance from 203 to 108 wagons; (iv) Average dwell time of foreign wagons from an average of 28 days to 12 days; (v) Locomotive detention at terminal and in transit yards; (vi) Transit times from an average of 15 days to 3 days. (b) Increase of: (i) Locomotive and wagon utilization, when in use, from 280 km per day to 380 km for locomotives and from 73 km per day to 120 km for wagons; (ii) Wagon productivity from an average of 20 loadings to 28 loadings per annum. Production of on-time performance statistics (c) which allow the development of strategies for improve- ment of the business and organization in general. (d) Commercial benefits: (i) The ability to respect delivery times, either agreed with customers or set by TRC, through daily monitoring of wagon movements; (ii) The ability to inform customers of the status and position of their cargo while on the TRC network;14 (iii) The more reliable supply of wagons to customers through the ability to trace and control wagons; Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC) is one of 205. the railways on which RailTracker has been successfully installed.13 While it has provided customers with current information on the location of their consignments, the system has provided TRC management with useful information enabling them to better serve customers. The successful the RailTracker computer system has had significant benefits to TRC at both strategic and tactical management levels. The major achievements of the information system have been: implementation of installation and (a) Reduction of: (i) Wagon turn-around time from an average of 18 days in 1994 to currently 13 days; (ii) Wagon detention at terminals from an average of 8 days to 4 days; (iv) Daily on information payments received and outstanding, assists in the control of cash flow and allocation of equipment; (v) Daily freight loading statistics assist in meeting weekly targets. to 206. RailTracker has contributed improving services to TRC customers and utilization of rolling stock. Surveys done by TRC on customer needs have indicated that the second most important requirement was information on the location of cargo. RailTracker has provided a tool to allow TRC to progress from the days of "ask tomorrow" to nearly perfect information on the location of cargo. The improvements in information systems, together with other corporate strategies, has enabled TRC to increase and sustain their market share for services compared to the low demand of the early 1990s.

112 Box 4 Transit transport services accessing to sea ports in selected landlocked countries in Africa West Africa Burkina Faso As a landlocked country, with the nearest coastal ports in neighbouring Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana and Togo, Burkina Faso's transport costs are a significant consideration for any business with export or import activities. The Government is undertaking a $360 million transport sector development programme, funded by the World Bank, which aims to develop a coherent transport policy and regulatory framework, rehabilitate the road and rail networks, and restructure the transport parastatals. There are 12,100 km of road networks, but only 16 per cent are paved. Some 90 per cent of the transport programme's funds have thus been allocated to road maintenance and construction. Mali Even by regional standards, transport communications are poor, especially in the isolated western region. This region is only linked to Bamako by the extremely dilapidated railway line between Bamako and Dakar (Senegal), which has been virtually unchanged since its completion in 1924. Road transport in the north has been further disrupted by a conflict. A five-year $250 million road maintenance programme repair scheme is under way, mostly funded by donors. Total road networks represent 15,100 km, but only12.1 per cent of which are paved. Niger Despite considerable donor-funded expansion work, Niger's transport system remains inadequate. In 1994, for example, less than 8 per cent of the country's road network (10,100 km) was paved, although access to neighbouring countries has improved following work on the 428-km road between Zinder and Agadès, which is scheduled to form part of the trans-Sahara highway. Although there is no railway system as yet, the emphasis in transport development is on diversifying and improving access to seaports: as a landlocked country, Niger has to rely on the ports of Lomé (Togo) and Tema (Ghana) for its maritime transport. Eastern Africa Burundi Burundi has no railways and 14,500 km of roads, 7 per cent of which are paved. Burundi's main export routes are by road to Mombasa (Kenya) via Rwanda and Uganda, and to Dar es Salaam (United Republic of Tanzania). The road to Mombasa is better, although the Tanzanian route crosses only one border. The Burundi transport parastatal, Otraco, is barely surviving. The once vibrant privately-owned public transport sector has been harmed since 1993 by increased insecurity on most routes, fuel price increases and shortages of spare parts. Rwanda Nearly all of Rwanda's imports and exports travel over 1,500 km to Mombasa (Kenya) and Dar es Salaam (United Republic of Tanzania) via the region's road network. This keeps transport costs high, particularly since new weight limits for freight travelling through East Africa were imposed in 1998 and 1999. Rwanda's arterial roads are serviceable and better than their Ugandan and Tanzanian counterparts. Rwanda has about 1,200 km of tarred roads and another 12,000 km of unpaved main and secondary roads, which are vulnerable to damage from heavy rain. After years of State control, commercial transport is now largely in private hands.

113 Box 4 (continued) Uganda The road network was earmarked for priority spending, not only on the major routes, but also on rural feeder roads, because of their importance in agricultural marketing. Landlocked Uganda is heavily dependent on transport links through Kenya and most of its foreign trade passes through Mombasa. The Government wants to reduce this dependence by developing links through the United Republic of Tanzania, via the lake port of Mwanja. Huge progress has been made in the road rehabilitation programme. Major trunk roads, such as the "northern corridor" route, have been completely resurfaced, and the condition of most urban and regional roads is much improved (although funding for upkeep is a problem). The road transport system still suffers from a shortage of vehicles and spares, but the situation is improving rapidly, with about 126,214 vehicles in use in 1996 compared with 31,000 in 1987. Competition for business between the ocean ports of Mombasa and Dar es Salaam has produced some benefits for Uganda's traders. The Tanzanian port has attracted business from Mombasa by cutting down transit times from 10- 14 days to 5-10 days, granting a 60-day moratorium on demurrage and opening shipping offices in Kampala. Goods shipped through Dar es Salaam use the Tanzanian railway link to Mwanza, from where there is a wagon ferry link to Port Bell almost daily. In response, the Kenyan authorities have introduced more trains between Kampala and Mombasa, which now run on a daily basis, subject to cargo availability. Meanwhile, a scheme to open a third route to the Indian Ocean, between Kampala, and Durban in South Africa, is suffering delays. Southern Africa Malawi As a landlocked country highly dependent on overland movement of exports and imports, Malawi's transport network and its connections to neighbouring countries is of the utmost economic importance. The shortest, cheapest trade routes are to the Mozambican ports of Nacala and Beira. Until 1982 around 95 per cent of Malawi's trade passed through those two ports, but throughout the 1980s and early 1990s the Mozambican civil war severely disrupted these crucial external trade routes, forcing much of the export and import traffic to be routed through distant ports in South Africa and the United Republic of Tanzania. Total transport costs increased by $50 million to $75 million per year, with insurance and freight costs rising from around 20 per cent of the cif import value in the early 1980s to 40 per cent by the later 1980s and only falling to 35-40 per cent in the mid-1990s. The end of the hostilities in Mozambique should benefit Malawi in the form of shorter and cheaper rail and road routes to the ports on the Mozambican coast. Railway routes in Mozambique sustained severe damage during the civil war and comprehensive rehabilitation on both sides of the border has been slow despite World Bank financing. The improved security situation in Mozambique has already led to a rise in traffic through Beira port, although traffic on the railway line between Blantyre and Beira has not increased significantly. Malawi's domestic road network is inadequate. At the time of independence in 1964 the country had 10,124 km of roads, of which only 431 km were bitumen-paved. By 1985 the road network had increased to only 11,051 km, although the length of bitumen roads had increased to 2,061 km. By 1999 the road system had been expanded to 16,500 km, 19 per cent of which were paved.

114 Box 4 (continued) Zambia Zambian post-independence transport policy has primarily been concerned with securing access to regional ports. Beira in Mozambique is the nearest major port and is linked by rail to Lusaka, via Harare in Zimbabwe. Further away, but better equipped and also accessible by rail, is Durban (South Africa). Dar es Salaam (United Republic of Tanzania), which was extensively used for Zambian trade when Beira and Durban were inaccessible for political reasons, has recently experienced a shrinking of its market share, but continues to handle around 70 per cent of Zambia's exports and 40 per cent of its imports. Zambia has 66,800 km of roads, of which approximately 12,000 km are paved. The road network was in poor condition, but in 1998 the National Roads Board announced a $1 billion investment programme for the road sector, to run for 10 years. Money for this is derived from donors, a fuel levy and counterpart funding, but some form of user charges are also envisaged. Zimbabwe Zimbabwe is a landlocked country with a well-developed road network that includes 15,000 km of tarred roads. Its closest access to the sea which is the port of Beira, lies eastwards through Mozambique. From the mid-1960s until the mid-1980s successive border closures, first by Zambia and then by Mozambique, followed by South Africa's destabilization war in Mozambique, forced Zimbabwe to reroute nearly all its overseas traffic through distant South African ports. With the return of peace, Beira has slowly regained its former importance. Zimbabwe has a direct rail link with Zambia via the Victoria Falls, which in theory continues to the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam; in addition, there are two links with Mozambique, to the ports of Beira and Maputo, and two links with South Africa, one through Botswana, the other via Beitbridge. Another link is planned between Beitbridge and Bulawayo. The National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) has been reformed with the aid of the World Bank. It is now required to operate commercially in preparation for privatization.
