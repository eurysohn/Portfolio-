New Product Forecasting Methods  Customer/market research 57%  Exponential smoothing  Jury of executive opinion  Sales force composite  Looks-like analysis  Trend line analysis 44% 39% 30% 19%  Experience curves  Delphi method  Linear Regression  Decision trees  Moving average 15%  Simulation  Scenario analysis 14%  Others: 10% 10% 8% 7% 5% 4% 9% • Methods differ by stage and by new product type. • On an average, companies use 3 different methods to forecast new products. • Business-to-Business (B2B) firms tend to use qualitative forecasts more than the Business-to-Consumer (B2C) firms. • B2B firms have a longer forecasting horizon (34 months) compared to the B2C firms (18 months.) Adapted from Kahn, Kenneth (2006) New Product Forecasting. * Based on a survey of 168 companies. CTL.SC1x - Supply Chain and Logistics Fundamentals Lesson: Forecasting for Special Cases

“Looks-Like” or Analogous Forecasting • How to do it  Look for comparable product launches  Create month by month (week by week) sales record  Use the percent of total sales as guide to trajectory  Similar to using “comps” in real estate • Structured Analogy  Create database of past launches (sales over time)  Characterize each launch by  Product type  Season of introduction  Price  Target market demographics  Physical characteristics  Use characteristics of new product to query old launches  Avoid only including successful launches!

Bass Diffusion Model • Two effects driving product adoption:  Innovation Effect (p)  Innovators are early adopters – high intrinsic tendency to adopt  They are drawn to the technology regardless of who else is using it  Innovator demand peaks early in the lifecycle  Imitation Effect (q)  Imitators hear about the product by word of mouth  They are influenced by behavior of their peers & social contagion  Imitator demand peaks later in the lifecyle s r e t p o d A f o # Imitators Innovators CTL.SC1x - Supply Chain and Logistics Fundamentals Lesson: Forecasting for Special Cases 15 Time

Bass Diffusion Model s r e t p o d A f o # Imitators Innovators Innovation Effect Imitation Effect Time n(t) = p x [Remaining Potential] + q x [Adopters] x [Remaining Potential] n(t) = p [m-N(t-1)] + q[N(t-1)/m][m-N(t-1)] Example: iWidget Sales Management estimates the iWidget has a 4 year product life with total sales of 750,000 units. They estimate that p=0.10 and q=0.25 for this product. Project sales by quarter: Q1 = (.10)(750-0)+(.25)(0)(750-0)=75k Q2 = (.10)(750-75)+(.25)(75/750)(750-75)=84k Q3 . . . . Where: p = Coefficient of innovation q = Coefficient of imitation m = Total number of customers who will adopt n(t) = Number of customers adopting at time t N(t-1) = Cumulative number of customers by time t Quarter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Innovation Effect 75 68 59 50 41 32 24 18 13 9 6 4 3 2 1 1 Imitation Effect - 17 31 42 47 46 41 34 26 19 14 9 6 4 3 2 Cum.

Bass Diffusion Model Parameters • So where do these p & q values come from? Typical values:  Look for previous studies  Identify “like” products in terms of - p ~ 0.03 and often <0.01 - q ~ 0.38 and 0.3≤q≤0.5  Environmental context (e.g., socioeconomic and regulatory environments)  Market structure (e.g., barriers to entry, number of competitors)  Buyer behavior (e.g., consumer, business)  Marketing mix strategies (e.g., promotion, pricing)  Characteristics of the innovation (e.g., complexity, relative advantage) Parameter values differ over time and vary by regions. Good for estimating sales trajectories – not absolute sales Provides estimate of time of peak sales: t*=ln(q/p)/(p+q) Product Innovation Coefficient p Imitation Coefficient q Cable TV Cell Phone Curling Irons Dishwasher Drip Coffeemaker Radio Microwave Non-durable product Home PC .100 .008 .028 .0014 .017 .027 .002 .023 .121 .060 .421 .993 .206 .993 .435 .357 .788 .281 Sources from Lilien G. and A.

Estimating Diffusion Models CTL.SC1x - Supply Chain and Logistics Fundamentals Lesson: Forecasting for Special Cases 18

Estimating p & q from Recent Sales First, transform Bass Model into linear equation: Second, estimate the regression equation using past sales periods. Third, back calculate for the parameters: where: CTL.SC1x - Supply Chain and Logistics Fundamentals Lesson: Forecasting for Special Cases 19

Example: Diffusion Model • Suppose I have the following sales information for the first 5 quarters of a product launch: Quarter 1 2 3 4 5 n(t) 160 223 310 425 575 N(t-1) 0 160 383 693 1,118 N(t-1)^2 0 25,600 146,689 480,249 1,249,924 • Regress using the LINEST function giving me: (0.000093) 0.0001066 0.98 48.17 0.4765 0.1333 35.32 2 120,203.73 2,495.47 160.18 30.31 #N/A #N/A #N/A b2 sb2 R2 b1 sb1 se df SSR SSE F b0 sb0 • Back solving for p, q, m: m= 5430 p= 0.030 q= 0.506 • My regression equation becomes: nt = 160.18 + (0.4765)Nt-1 – (0.000093)(Nt-1)2 • Use these parameters to estimate future sales or compare to similar past product launches CTL.SC1x - Supply Chain and Logistics Fundamentals Lesson: Forecasting for Special Cases 20

Forecasting Products with Intermittent Demand CTL.SC1x - Supply Chain and Logistics Fundamentals Lesson: Forecasting for Special Cases 21

Problems with Intermittent Demand • Suppose I had an item that is ordered every 6 months for 1,000 units. Average monthly demand = 2000/12 = 167 units. • What happens if I forecast demand using simple exponential smoothing: ) s t i n u ( d n a m e D 1000 900 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Actual Demand x^(t,t+1) CTL.SC1x - Supply Chain and Logistics Fundamentals Lesson: Forecasting for Special Cases 22

Problems with Intermittent Demand • Or more realistically, my demand for product is infrequent, of different size, and irregularly ordered. • Forecasting demand using simple exponential smoothing results in additional noise. • Separate components of demand and model separately:  Time between transactions  Magnitude of individual transactions ) s t i n u ( d n a m e D 2000 1800 1600 1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Actual Demand x^(t,t+1) CTL.SC1x - Supply Chain and Logistics Fundamentals Lesson: Forecasting for Special Cases 40 23

Croston’s Method Demand process: If demand is independent between time periods, then the probability that a transaction occurs is 1/n, that is: The updating procedure becomes: If xt=0 (no transaction occurs), z^ n^ t = z^ t = n^ t-1 t-1 If xt>0 (transaction occurs), t =αxt + (1-α) z^ t-1 t =βnt + (1-β) n^ z^ n^ t-1 Where: xt = Demand in period t yt = 1 if transaction occurs in period t, =0 otherwise zt = Size (magnitude) of transaction in time t nt = Number of periods since last transaction α= Smoothing parameter for magnitude β = Smoothing parameter for transaction frequency Forecast x^ t,t+1 = z^ t /n^ t CTL.SC1x - Supply Chain and Logistics Fundamentals Lesson: Forecasting for Special Cases 24 Approach adapted from Silver, Pyke, & Peterson (1998), Inventory Management and Production Planning and Scheduling

Croston’s Method – An Example • Using same data:  Average demand per year ~2,000 units Irregular transaction size and time between orders  • Create a forecast for demand going forward using Croston’s method =E7/F7 =IF(B6>0,1,D6+1) =IF(B7>0,$C$1*B7+(1-$C$1)*E6,E6) =IF(B7>0,$C$2*D7+(1-$C$2)*F6,F6) ) s t i n u ( d n a m e D 2000 1800 1600 1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Actual Demand x^(t,t+1) CTL.SC1x - Supply Chain and Logistics Fundamentals Lesson: Forecasting for Special Cases 25

Croston’s Method • Essentially shifts the updating to only after an order occurs.  Smooths out the forecast for replenishment purposes – average usage per period  Unbiased and has lower variance than simple smoothing. • Cautions  Infrequent updating introduces a lag to responding to magnitude changes  Recommended use of smoothing for MSE of non-zero transaction periods CTL.SC1x - Supply Chain and Logistics Fundamentals Lesson: Forecasting for Special Cases 26

Forecasting Wrap Up CTL.SC1x - Supply Chain and Logistics Fundamentals Lesson: Forecasting for Special Cases 27

Demand Process – Three Key Questions What should we do to shape and create demand for our product? Demand Planning  Product & Packaging  Promotions  Pricing  Place What should we expect demand to be given the demand plan in place? Demand Forecasting  Strategic, Tactical, Operational  Considers internal & external factors  Baseline, unbiased, & unconstrained How do we prepare for and act on demand when it materializes? Demand Management  Balances demand & supply  Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP)  Bridges both sides of a firm Material adapted from Lapide, L. (2006) Course Notes, ESD.260 Logistics Systems. CTL.SC1x - Supply Chain and Logistics Fundamentals Lesson: Forecasting for Special Cases 28

Many Forecast Methods & Approaches • Subjective Approaches  Judgmental – someone somewhere knows  Experimental – sample local and extrapolate • Objective Approaches  Time Series – pattern matching a  Simple models (Moving Average, Cumulative, Naïve)  Exponential smoothing - balancing new & old information  Smoothing constants determine “nervousness” & response  Lots of bookkeeping, updating & tricky initialization  Causal Analysis – underlying drivers  Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression  A single dependent variable (y) and one or more independent variables (x1, x2, …)  Testing the model and individual coefficients  Watch-Outs: Correlation ≠ Causation & Avoid over-fitting time time time time b F • Most firms use a portfolio of different techniques & methods CTL.SC1x - Supply Chain and Logistics Fundamentals Lesson: Forecasting for Special Cases 29

Special Cases for Forecasting • New Products  No history – there fore needed new methods  “Looks Like” Forecasting  Diffusion Models (innovator and imitator)  Different types of new products – Different methods  New-to-World  New-to-Company  Line Extensions  Product Improvements  Product Re-Positioning  Cost Reductions  New product development process (stages & gates) • Intermittent Demand  Croston’s Method – smooths out sporadic and irregular transactions CTL.SC1x - Supply Chain and Logistics Fundamentals Lesson: Forecasting for Special Cases 30

Final Forecasting Comments • Data Issues Dominate  Sales data is not demand data  Transactions can aggregate and skew actual demand  Historical data might not exist • Practical Things to Look For  Forecasting vs. Inventory Management (avoid bias)  Statistical Validity vs. Use and Cost of Model  Demand is not always exogenous  Error trending over time – is it creeping? • Hidden Costs of Complexity – the more complex the system:  the less frequently the parameters are checked and updated  the less likely anyone who uses the system understands it  the less likely operational teams will trust the output CTL.SC1x - Supply Chain and Logistics Fundamentals Lesson: Forecasting for Special Cases 31
