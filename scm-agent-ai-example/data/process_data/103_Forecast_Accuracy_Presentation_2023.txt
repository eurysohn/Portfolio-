Forecast Accuracy - Abstract Demand visibility is a vital component of an effective supply chain. • Forecast accuracy at the primitive SKU level is critical for proper allocation of supply chain resources. • Inaccurate demand forecasts often would result in supply imbalances when it comes to meeting customer demand. In this paper, we will discuss the process of measuring forecast accuracy, the pros and cons of different accuracy metrics, and the time-lag with which accuracy should be measured. We will also discuss a method to identify and track forecast bias.

Demand Plan ➢ Demand Plan is a statement of expected future demand that is derived using a statistical forecast and enhanced with customer intelligence. ➢ Demand Plans need to be ➢ Unbiased ➢ Timely ➢ In relevant detail ➢ Covering the appropriate time horizon ➢ What is different between Long-term and Short-term Planning? © 2023 Valtitude 3

Short-term Planning ➢Critical for tactical planning ➢Limited flexibility to reschedule resources So Make or Break it! ➢Inaccurate forecast means • Lost sale • Lost customer • Excess inventory • Other inefficiencies © 2023 Valtitude 4

Long-term Forecasts ➢ Market or economy-oriented ➢ Useful for • Capacity Planning • Setting Strategic initiatives ➢ More flexibility to change and err ➢ Accuracy at an aggregate or macro level is more important ➢ So, mix matters less in Long-term forecasting! © 2023 Valtitude 5

Forecast Error ➢Forecast Error is the deviation of the Actual from the forecasted quantity Error = Absolute Value of {(Actual - Forecast)} Error % = Absolute Value of {(Actual - Forecast)} Actual ➢Deviation vs. Direction • The first is the magnitude of the Error • The second implies bias, if persistent © 2023 Valtitude 7

Forecast Accuracy ➢ Forecast Accuracy is a measure of how close the Actual Demand is to the forecasted quantity. • Forecast Accuracy is the converse of Error • Accuracy (%) = 1 – Error (%) ➢ However, we truncate the Impact of Large Forecast If Actual equals Forecast, then Accuracy = 100% Errors at 100%. More formally • • Error > 100% ➔ 0% Accuracy • We constrain Accuracy to be between 0 and 100% ➢ Algebraically, • Accuracy = maximum of (1 – Error, 0) © 2023 Valtitude 8

CALCULATION METHODOLOGY ➢How to calculate a performance measure for forecast accuracy? ➢How do we aggregate errors across products and customers? ➢What are the different error measurements available? ➢How do you define the Mean Absolute Percent Error? ➢What is the weighted MAPE? © 2023 Valtitude 10

Aggregating Errors To compute one metric of accuracy across a group of items, we need to calculate an Average Error ➢ Simple but Intuitive Method • Add all the absolute errors across all items • Divide the above by the total actual quantity • Define the average error as Sum of all Errors divided by the sum of Actual quantity ➢ This is known as WAPE or Weighted Absolute Percentage Error!!!! ➢ WAPE is also known as WMAPE, MAD/Mean ratio. © 2023 Valtitude 11

Example of WAPE calculation SKU A SKU B SKU X SKU Y Total Actual Forecast Absolute Error 25 75 50 50 0 50 Error (%) 200% 100% Accuracy (%) 0% 0% 75 25 50 67% 33% 74 75 1 1% 99% 224 175 151 67% 33% WAPE © 2023 Valtitude 12

Different ways to err! ➢Mean Percent Error – MPE ➢Mean Absolute Percent Error - MAPE ➢Mean Absolute Deviation - MAD ➢Weighted Absolute Percent Error – WAPE or WMAPE ➢Root Mean Squared Error - RMSE © 2023 Valtitude 13

Different ways to err! ➢ Mean Percent Error (MPE) is an Average of the Percentage Errors. Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) is an Average of the Percentage Errors. • These ignore the scale of the numbers. • MPE can be positive or negative, MAPE is always positive. ➢ Weighted Absolute Percent Error (WAPE or WMAPE) is the Sum of Absolute errors divided by the Sum of the Actuals  Actual − Forecast WMAPE =  Actual • WAPE gives you a true picture of forecastquality in an organizationand how this will impact the business performance in both Sales and profits. • WAPE can also be construed as the Average Absolute Error divided by the Average Actual quantity © 2023 Valtitude 14

Root Mean Squared Error ➢ Mean Squared Error is the Average of the squared errors (hence positive). ➢ Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the classic Statistical Error – very similar to Standard Deviation. M S E =  ( Act u a l − F o re c a s t ) 2 N R M S E = M S E © 2023 Valtitude 15

Why WAPE? ➢ WAPE gives you the best read on how the quality of forecasting will affect the Organization – Top line results, Profitability and the general quality of life of the supply chain participants. ➢ MAPE/MPE • very unstable • will be skewed by small values • In the Example, SKU A drives most of the Error. ➢ WAPE is simple and elegant while robust as a computational measure! © 2023 Valtitude 17

MAPE vs. WAPE ➢ The MAPE is un-weighted and hence commits the sin of averaging percentages. • Assumes the absolute error on each item is equally important. • Large error on a low-value item or C item can unfairly skew the overall error. ➢ WAPE is volume weighted but can be value weighted either by standard cost or list price • High-value items will influence the overall error • So it is better to use WAPE for volume weighted MAPE and WMAPE for dollar weighted or Cost-weighted measures. • We denote WMAPE_p to mean price weighted MAPE and • WMAPE_c to mean Cost weighted MAPE. © 2023 Valtitude 18

WMAPE ➢Weighted MAPE or Value weighted MAPE • WMAPE = (w*|(A-F))|/ (w*A) • Both Error and Actuals are weighted • The weight can even be a subjective measure based on criticality of the item. ➢ High-value items will influence the overall error ➢ Highly correlated with safety stock requirements ➢ Very useful in setting safety stock strategies © 2023 Valtitude 19

Forecast Bias Bias is the tendency for error to be persistent in one direction. Most bias can be classified into one of two main categories: ➢Forecaster bias occurs when error is in one direction for all items. ➢Business Process Bias occurs when error is in one direction for specific items over a period of time. © 2023 Valtitude 25

Type 1 Bias ➢ This is a subjective bias. Occurs due to human intervention (often erroneous) to build unnecessary forecast safeguards. Examples: • Increase forecast to match Division Goal • Adjust forecast to reflect the best case volume scenario in response to a promotion • Building a forecast component to reflect production uncertainty (in effect, doubling the safety stock) • Organization’s natural tendency to over-forecast due to high visibility of product outs compared to excess inventory ➢ This bias results in • Increased inventories and • Higher risk of obsolescence. © 2023 Valtitude 27

To establish that a forecast is biased, you have to prove that the net bias is statistically significant using standard confidence intervals. © 2023 Valtitude 28

Type 2 Bias ➢ This bias is a manifestation of business process specific to the product. ➢ This can either be an over-forecasting or under-forecasting bias. This bias is hard to control, unless the underlying business process itself is restructured. ➢ Examples: • Items specific to a few customers • Persistent demand trend when forecast adjustments are slow to respond to such trends • Distribution changes of an item over time • Either item getting distribution across new customers over time or • Item slowly going through an attrition with delistments over time. © 2023 Valtitude 29

Bias – Is there a remedy? ➢ If bias is type 1, correcting the forecast is easy but making the organization adjust to unbiased forecasting is the harder sell. • Since Arithmetic accuracy conveys similar information as absolute accuracy, using a mass counter-adjustment is the easiest solution. • In Case 1, slashing the forecast across the board by 33% would dramatically increase the accuracy. ➢ If bias is type 2 • Each item bias needs to examined for specific process reasons. • Process needs to be re-adjusted © 2023 Valtitude 30

Industry Benchmark Measurement ➢ We measure item level absolute accuracy using an one-month bucket and a three-month bucket. ➢ The one-month accuracy is measured using a two-month lag forecast ie. May actuals measured using March forecast ➢ The three-month accuracy is measured using an one-month lag forecast ie. May-July actuals using April forecast. ➢ Business policy issue • Quarter close effects • Unannounced business deals ➢ The above have an effect on one-month accuracy but NOT on three-month accuracy. © 2023 Valtitude 32

Safety stock ➢ Safety stock is defined • As the component of total inventory needed to cover unanticipated fluctuation in demand or supply or both • As the inventory needed to defend against a forecast error ➢ Hence Forecast error is a key driver of safety stock. ➢ Here we illustrate the basic safety stock concept that covers demand volatility but not deviations in supply lead time or variability. © 2023 Valtitude 34

Safety Stock Calculation ➢Using all three determinants of Safety stock, • SS = SL * Forecast Error * Lead Time ➢ SL is Customer Service Level • Generally, set at 98% (why?) • Which translates into a multiple of 2.054 (why?) ➢ Forecast Error used is the Root Mean Squared Error ➢ Lead time is either weeks or months, consistent with the forecast measurement period. ➢ However, we do not consider variability in lead time or the supply quantity. ➢ Also, we do not consider the interaction between lot size, variability as well as the effect of order frequency. © 2023 Valtitude 35

Importance of Forecast Error ➢Lead times are externally determined • Supplier Considerations • Structure of your Supply Chain ➢Service Level Targets are typically in a narrow band between 95% and 99.5% ➢Hence Forecast Error is the big driver of safety stock. © 2023 Valtitude 36

Forecast Bias ➢ Does Bias affect Safety stock? • Depends on whether it is type 1 or type 2 bias. • If bias can be quantified, then there is no uncertainty and hence no need for additional safety stock ➢ If this is a type 1 bias, adjustment is easy • Add or subtract the bias to the forecasted quantity to arrive at your supply • Safety stock needs to be adjusted down to match the error contributed by the bias © 2023 Valtitude 38
