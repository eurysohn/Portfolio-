Glossary All Fast: The point when the ship is fully secured at berth, and all mooring lines are fast. Arrival: The total elapsed time between the Au- tomatic Identification System (AIS) recorded ar- rival at the actual port limit (so excludes waiting time at anchorage) and the vessel all lines fast at the berth. Berth Hours: The time elapsed from all lines fast to all lines released. Call size: The number of container moves per call. Crane Intensity (CI): The quantity of cranes de- ployed to a ship’s berth call. Calculated as total accumulated gross crane hours divided by oper- ating (first to last move) hours. Factor analysis (FA): A statistical method used to describe variability among observed, correlat- ed variables in terms of a potentially lower num- ber of unobserved variables called factors. Finish: Total elapsed time between last contain- er move and all lines released. Gross Crane Hours: Aggregated total working time for all cranes deployed to a vessel call with- out any deductions. Time includes breakdowns, inclement weather, vessel inspired delays, un/ lashing, gantry, boom down/up plus hatch cover and gear-box handling. Gross Crane Productivity (GCMPH): Call Size or total moves divided by total gross crane hours. Hub port: A port which is called at by deep-sea mainline container ships and serves as a trans- shipment point for smaller outlying, or feeder, ports within its geographical region. Typically, more than 35 percent of its total throughput would be hub and spoke transshipment contain- er activity. Moves: Total container moves. Discharge + re- stowage moves + load. Excluding hatch covers, gearboxes, and so on. Moves per Crane: Total Moves for a Call divided by the Crane Intensity. Other Berth Hours: Activities between All-fast and first Lift (“Start”) plus the time taken to de- part from the berth (All Lines Released) after the Last container Lift (“finish”). Other Port Hours +“Arrival”: The combination of idle/waiting time at anchorage plus the time required to steam-in from the Port Limits and un- til All-fast alongside the berth. Port Call: A call to a container port/terminal by a container vessel where at least one container was discharged or loaded. Port Hours: The number of hours a ship spends at/in port, from arrival at the port limits to sailing from the berth. Port to Berth Hours: The time from when a ship first arrived at the port limits or anchorage zone until it is all fast alongside the berth. Ship size: Nominal capacity in Twenty foot Equivalent Units or TEUs. Start: The time elapsed from berthing (all lines fast) to first container move. Steam in time: The time required to steam-in from the Port Limits and until All-fast alongside the berth. Twenty Foot Equivalent Unit or TEU: A stan- dard metric for container throughput, and the physical capacity of a container terminal. A 20- foot container is equal to 1 TEU, and a 40-foot or 45-foot container is equal to 2 TEUs. Regard- less of container size (10 feet, 15 feet, 20 feet, 30 feet, 40 feet, or 45 feet), each is recorded as one move when being loaded or discharged from the vessel. Vessel capacity: Nominal capacity in Twenty foot Equivalent Units or TEUs. Waiting Time: Total elapsed time from when vessel enters anchorage zone to when vessel departs anchorage zone (vessel speed must have dropped below 0.5 knots for at least 15 mins within the zone). v | GLOSSARY

foreword The COVID-19 pandemic, the March 2021 blocking of the Suez Canal by a container ship that had run aground, and the more recent shock engendered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continue to impact the global economy. The most visible indications of stress in the system are the shortages of certain products, the ships waiting at anchorage outside the major maritime ports, and the impact on the cost of goods. These challenges also continue to underline the critical role that ports, and their associated logistical chains, play in the global economy. A great variety of public and private stakeholders interact in a port to maintain the flows of vital med- ical and food supplies, critical agricultural products, energy streams, and other goods and services essential to facilitate the economic life of a country. These interactions comprise physical interactions, such as cargo-handling operations, vessel-related services, and transfers to/from land-based modes for imports and exports. Maritime transport carries over 80 percent of global merchandise trade by volume, and any impedi- ment or friction at the port will have tangible repercussions for their respective hinterlands and popula- tions. In the short term, this is likely to take the form of shortages of essential goods and higher prices, as we saw early in the pandemic. But over the medium to longer term, an inefficient port will result in slower economic growth, less employment, and higher costs for importers and exporters. Despite the centrality of the port to global value chains, one of the major challenges to stimulating improvement has been the lack of a reliable, consistent, and comparable basis on which to compare operational performance across different ports. While modern ports collect data for performance pur- poses, the quality, consistency, and availability of data, the definitions employed, and the capacity and willingness of the organizations to collect and transmit data to a collating body have all precluded the development of a robust comparable measure(s) to assess performance across ports and time. However, the introduction of new technologies, increased digitalization, and the willingness on the part of industry interests to work collectively toward systemwide improvements now provide the capacity and the opportunity to measure and compare container port performance in a robust and reliable manner. This technical report, which represents the second edition of the Container Port Performance Index (CPPI), has been produced by the Transport Global Practice of the World Bank in collaboration with the Maritime, Trade and Supply Chain division of S&P Global Market Intelligence. The CPPI is intended, as in its earlier iteration, to serve as a reference point for improvement for key stakeholders in the global economy, including national governments, port authorities and operators, development agencies, supranational organizations, various maritime interests, and other public and private stakeholders in trade, logistics, and supply chain services. The CPPI is not intended to cover the entire performance of a port, but to illustrate opportunities for improvement and, hopefully, stimu- late a dialogue among key stakeholders to move this essential agenda forward.

executive summary Maritime transport is the backbone of globalized trade and the manufacturing supply chain. The mari- time sector offers the most economical, energy efficient, and reliable mode of transportation over long distances. More than four-fifths of global merchandise trade (by volume) is carried by sea. A significant and growing portion of that volume, accounting for approximately 35 percent of total volumes and more than 60 percent of commercial value, is carried in containers. The growth of containerization has led to vast changes in the where and the how goods are manufactured and processed, a process that continues to evolve. Container ports, accordingly, are critical nodes in global supply chains and central to the growth strategies of many emerging economies. In many cases, the development of high-qual- ity container port infrastructure, operated efficiently, has been a prerequisite to successful export-led growth strategies. It can facilitate investment in production and distribution systems, supporting the expansion of manufacturing and logistics, creating employment, and raising income levels. Accordingly, how a maritime port performs is a crucial element in the cost of international trade for a country. Unfortunately, ports and terminals, particularly for containers, can often be sources of ship- ment delays, supply chain disruptions, additional costs, and reduced competitiveness. Poorly perform- ing ports are characterized by limitations in spatial and operating efficiency, limitations in maritime and landside access, inadequate oversight, and poor coordination between the public agencies involved, resulting in a lack of predictability and reliability. Poor performance can also have an impact far beyond the hinterland of a port: Container shipping services are operated on fixed schedules with vessel turn- around at each of the ports of call on the route planned within the allocated time for port stay. Poor performance at one port on the route could disrupt the entire schedule. The result far too often is that instead of facilitating trade, the port increases the cost of imports and exports, reduces the compet- itiveness of its host country and its hinterland, and inhibits economic growth and poverty reduction. These impacts can be particularly pronounced for landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and the small island developing states (SIDS). Despite the centrality of the port to global value chains, one of the major challenges to stimulating improvement has been the lack of a reliable, consistent, and comparable basis on which to compare operational performance across different ports. While modern ports collect data for performance pur- poses, the quality, consistency, and availability of data; the definitions employed; and the capacity and willingness of the organizations to collect and transmit data to a collating body have all precluded the development of a comparable measure(s) to assess performance across ports and time. The intro- duction of new technologies, increased digitalization, and the willingness of industry interests to work collectively toward systemwide improvements has now provided the opportunity to measure and com- pare container port performance in a robust and reliable manner. This technical paper, which presents the second edition of the Container Port Performance Index (CPPI), has been produced by the World Bank’s Transport Global Practice in collaboration with the Maritime, Trade and Supply Chain division of S&P Global Market Intelligence. The CPPI is intended to identify gaps and opportunities for improvement that will ultimately benefit all stakeholders from shipping lines to national governments to consumers. The CPPI is intended to serve as a reference point for key stakeholders in the global economy, including national governments, port authorities and operators, development agencies, supranational organizations, various maritime inter- ests, and other public and private stakeholders in trade, logistic, and supply chain services. 1 | ExECUTIVE SUMMARY

The development of the CPPI rests on total port time in the manner explained in subsequent sections of the report. This second iteration utilizes data for the full calendar year 2021. It includes ports that had a minimum of 20 valid port calls within the 12-month period of the study. Accordingly, the num- ber of ports covered has increased from 351 in CPPI 2020 to 370 in this edition. The CPPI 2021 has again employed two different methodological approaches, an administrative, or technical, approach, a pragmatic methodology reflecting expert knowledge and judgment, and a statistical approach, using factor analysis (fA). The rationale for using two approaches was to try and ensure that the ranking of container port performance reflects as closely as possible actual port performance, whilst also being statistically robust. The two approaches are explained later in the report, with further detail on the latter provided in appendix B. Table E.1 presents the CPPI 2021 using the same two methodological approaches. The ranking and score in the right-hand columns result from the use of the statistical approach and the ranking and score in the left-hand columns result from the administrative approach. The index points used to con- struct the ranking in the administrative approach reflect the approach outlined in chapter 2 of the report, which is an aggregate of the performance of the port, weighted relative to the average, across call and vessel size. Accordingly, the score can be negative, where a port compares poorly to the average in one call size and vessel size category, particularly if it does not have an offsetting positive score(s) in other cell(s). Appendix A, table A.1, also provides the score for each port, by call size and vessel size, and hence potential areas of focus for interventions. further iterations of the CPPI will ex- plore the determinants of the ranking in more detail. The use of fA also results in a statistic (a total score) that is the sum of a weighted average of indices for each of the same five vessel sizes: feeders (<1,500 TEUs), intra-regional (1,500–5,000 TEUs), inter- mediate (5,000–8,500 TEUs), neo-Panamax (8,500–13,500 TEUs), and ultra-large container carriers (>13,500 TEU). The indices for each vessel size are estimated based on the time expired in the port and a number of unknown factors, or latent variables (see appendix B for a more detailed explana- tion of the approach), which impact on performance, but cannot be seen. The resulting total scores are standardized, with a “negative” score indicating a performance that is better than the average. Overall, there is a marked improvement in consistency between the rankings that result from the two approaches, and a considerable reduction in divergences compared to CPPI 2020. The two top-ranked container ports in the CPPI 2021 are king Abdullah Port (Saudi Arabia) in first place, followed by the Port of Salalah (Oman) in second place. These two ports occupy the same positions in the rankings generated by both approaches. king Abdullah Port was ranked second in both approaches in CPPI 2020. The Port of Salalah ranked sixth and ninth in the statistical and admin- istrative approaches, respectively, in CPPI 2020. Of the top 10 ranked ports, all have improved their position since CPPI 2020, with Jeddah and Hamad Port moving up 35 and 34 positions in the ranking, respectively. The exceptions are Yokohama, which has fallen from first place in both approaches in 2020, to 10th and 12th in CPPI 2021 in the administrative and statistical approaches, respectively, and Guangzhou, which dropped from sixth to ninth place in the administrative approach. There are 37 new entrants to the CPPI 2021, and a number of significant movers in terms of their ranking since the CPPI 2020. One hundred and forty-nine ports improved their rankings in CPPI 2021, compared to CPPI 2020, with some of the largest improvers increasing their ranking by over 200 po- sitions. By contrast, the ranking of 182 ports fell in the CPPI 2021, over the inaugural edition, with some of the largest movers falling nearly 300 positions, reflecting the challenges faced by ports during the period of the study. execuTive summary | 2

The CPPI 2021 also sees a marked reduction in discrepancies between the findings of the adminis- trative and statistical approaches compared to CPPI 2020. In CPPI 2020, just under 18 percent of all ports (61 ports) were ranked within three places or less from themselves in the dual rankings. In CPPI 2021, 38 percent of all ports (139 ports) are ranked within three places or less from themselves in the dual rankings (a 20 percent improvement). Approximately 40 percent (137 ports) were ranked within 10 places or less of themselves in the CPPI 2020. CPPI 2021 registered 267 ports (72 percent) which were ranked within 10 places or less of themselves, a 32 percent improvement on CPPI 2020 rankings. In CPPI 2021, the first 20 ports and final 20 ports are within an average of one place from themselves in the dual rankings. Looking to the future, the intention is that the CPPI will evolve and be enhanced in subsequent edi- tions, reflecting refinement, stakeholder feedback, and improvement in data scope and quality. The World Bank-S&P Global Market Intelligence team will continue to refine the methodologies; the scope, where possible increasing the number of ports; and the data. The overall objective remains the iden- tification of potential improvement to ultimately benefit all public and private stakeholders, including ports, shipping lines, governments, line agencies, businesses, and consumers. execuTive summary | 12

1. introduction Maritime transport is the backbone of globalized trade and the manufacturing supply chain, with more than four-fifths of global merchandise trade (by volume) carried by sea. The maritime sector offers the most economical and reliable mode of transportation over long distances. Over the past two decades, compound annual growth in maritime trade has been 2.9 percent. In 2020, maritime trade volumes were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but fell less dramatically than expected, and rebounded by the end of the year, but still ended the year down by 3.8 percent or 10.65 billion tons (UNCTAD 2021). Container trade, accounting for approximately 35 percent of total volume and more than 60 percent by value, fell by 1.2 percent from 2019 levels. Both overall maritime and container trade reflected the 3.5 percent fall in global economic output. Maritime ports have been central to economic and social development since the dawn of maritime trade. This is as true today as it has been for thousands of years. The growth of containerization, since Malcom McLean’s innovation in 1958 (Levinson 2006), has led to vast changes in where and how goods are manufactured, a dynamic process that has not yet stopped evolving. Container ports, as a result, have become critical nodes in global supply chains and are central to the growth stories and strategies of many emerging economies. In many cases, the development of high-quality port infrastructure, oper- ated efficiently, has been a prerequisite to successful, often export-led, growth strategies. Done well, it provides the necessary confidence to facilitate investment in production and distribution systems, sup- porting the expansion of manufacturing and logistics, creating employment, and raising income levels. 13 | inTroducTion

More specifically, how a maritime port performs is a crucial element in the cost of trading for a coun- try. Poorly performing ports constrain trade growth, an impact particularly pronounced for LLDCs and SIDS. The port, together with the access infrastructure (whether inland waterway, rail, or road) to the hinterland, constitutes a crucial link to the global marketplace and needs to operate efficiently. Efficient performance encompasses a myriad factors, including the efficiency of the port itself; the availability of sufficient draught, quay, and dock facilities; the quality of the connections to road and rail services; the competitiveness of those services; and the efficacy of the procedures employed by the public agencies involved in container clearance. Inefficiencies or nontariff barriers in any of these actors will result in higher costs, reduced competitiveness, and lower trade (kathuria 2018). The efficiency of port infrastructure has also been identified as a key contributor to overall port com- petitiveness and international trade costs. Micco et al. (2003) identified a link between port efficiency and the cost of international trade. Clark, Dollar, and Micco (2004) found a reduction in country ineffi- ciency, specifically transport cost, from the 25th to 75th percentile, resulted in an increase in bilateral trade of around 25 percent. Wilmsmeier, Hoffmann, and Sanchez (2006) confirmed the impact of port performance on international trade costs, finding that doubling port efficiency in a pair of ports had the same impact on trade costs as halving the physical distance between the ports. Hoffmann, Saeed, and Sødal (2020) analyzed the short- and long-term impacts of liner shipping bilateral connectivity on South Africa’s trade flows, and showed that gross domestic product (GDP), the number of common direct con- nections, and the level of competition have a positive and significant effect on trade flows. Unfortunately, ports and terminals, particularly for containers, can often be the main sources of ship- ment delays, supply chain disruptions, additional costs, and reduced competitiveness. Poorly perform- ing ports are characterized by limitations in spatial and operating efficiency, limitations in maritime and landside access, inadequate oversight, and poor coordination between the public agencies involved, resulting in a lack of predictability and reliability. The result far too often is that instead of facilitating trade, the port increases the cost of imports and exports, reduces competitiveness, and inhibits eco- nomic growth and poverty reduction. The effect on national and regional economies can be severe [see inter alia World Bank (2013)] and has driven numerous efforts to improve performance to strengthen competitiveness. Port performance is also a key consideration for container shipping lines that operate liner services on fixed schedules, based on fixed port turnaround times. Delays at any of the scheduled ports of call on the route served by the vessel would have to be made good before the vessel arrives at the next port of call in order to avoid an adverse impact on the efficient operations of the service. As such, port efficien- cy and port turnaround time at all the ports of call are important subjects for operators, and monitoring port performance has become an increasingly important undertaking in the competitive landscape. One of the major challenges to realize improvement has been the lack of reliable measures to compare operational performance across different ports. The old management idiom “you cannot manage what you cannot measure” is reflective of the challenge of both managing and overseeing the sector histori- cally. While modern ports collect data for performance purposes, it is difficult to compare the outcomes with competitors or with ports in similar circumstances, due to the lack of available comparative date. Managers may know that performance is improving year on year, but they may not know whether per- formance is up to the standards of leading ports with similar profiles. inTroducTion | 14

Perhaps not surprisingly, there is a long history of attempts to identify a comparative set of indicators to measure port or terminal performance. A brief review of the literature was provided in The Container Port Performance Index 2020: A Comparable Assessment of Container Port Performance (World Bank 2021), CPPI 2020, to illustrate the broad approaches identified in the literature and comment on the merits and demerits of each. The measures fell into three broad categories: firstly, measures of opera- tional and financial performance; secondly, measures of economic efficiency; and thirdly, measures that rely, predominately, on data from sources exogenous to the port. This review is not replicated in CPPI 2021, and interested readers are directed to CPPI 2020 (World Bank 2021), or the extant literature. One of the general challenges of nearly all the approaches has been the quality, consistency, and availability of data; the standardization of definitions employed; and the capacity and willingness of organizations to collect and transmit the data to a collating body. At a slightly higher level, there are several aggregate indicators that provide an indication of the com- parative quality and performance of maritime gateways. The World Bank Logistics Performance Index (LPI) (Arvis et al. 2018) and the World Economic forum’s Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) 4.0 both report on the perceived efficiency of seaport services and border clearance processes, and indicate the extent to which inefficiencies at a nation’s sea borders can impact international trade competitiveness. But the aggregate nature of the indicators, and the fact that they are perception based, means that they offer at best an indication of comparative performance and offer little to guide spatial or operating per- formance improvements at the level of the individual port. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD’s) Liner Shipping Connectivity Index (LSCI) provides an indicator of a port’s position within the liner shipping network, which is partly a result of the port’s performance, but does not directly measure it. Like the CPPI, the LSCI is limited to container ports. Digitalization offers an opportunity to measure and compare container port performance in a robust and reliable manner. New technologies, increased digitalization, and the willingness on the part of industry interests to work collectively toward systemwide improvements now provides the capacity and oppor- tunity to measure and compare container port performance in a robust and reliable manner. The data used to compile the CPPI 2021 is from S&P Global’s Port Performance Program. The Port Performance Program was started in 2009 with the goal of driving efficiency improvements in container port opera- tions and supporting programs to optimize port calls. The program includes 11 of the world’s largest liner shipping companies, which collectively operate close to 80 percent of global fleet capacity. The liner shipping companies provide the program with a series of operational time stamps for each indi- vidual port call. The data are provided monthly and cover the full global networks of each liner shipping company and their subsidiary shipping companies. In 2021, performance time stamp data were captured for 164,500 port calls involving 257.4 million container moves at 826 container terminals in 443 ports worldwide. The nature, source, and scope of the data are discussed in the subsequent chapter. The rationale behind the CPPI was to use available empirical data to create an objective measure to compare container port performance across ports, and eventually over time. Container port perfor- mance is most relevant from the perspective of customer experience and the speed and efficiency with which customer assets are handled. In this second edition of the CPPI, the focus remains purely on quayside performance reflecting the experience of a ship operator, the port’s main customer. The operational efficiency with which ports receive and turn around container ships is of critical importance 15 | inTroducTion

to the carrier’s decision to call a port in view of other options. The two methodologies employed in this study, and the justification for their use, are presented in summary in chapter 2, with further detail provided in appendices A and B. The results in terms of the CPPI 2022 are presented in chapter 3, with further detail provided in appendix A. The CPPI has been developed to contribute to the identification of opportunities for improvement that will ultimately benefit all public and private stakeholders. The CPPI is intended to serve as a reference point for key stakeholders in the global economy, including national governments, port authorities and operators, development agencies, supranational organizations, various maritime interests, and other public and private stakeholders engaged in trade, logistic, and supply chain services. The intention of the joint team is that the methodology, scope, and data will be enhanced in subsequent annual itera- tions, reflecting refinement, stakeholder feedback, and data scope and quality improvements.

2. The approach and methodology Introduction Container (liner) shipping services are generally highly structured service rotations. They are typically set up with weekly departure frequencies, a fixed sequence of port calls, and standard pro forma day and time-spe- cific berthing windows. Once a service has been defined or adjusted, it will usually remain intact for many months, or even years. The berthing windows are pre-agreed with the terminal and port operators, usually based on a slightly higher than expected average quantity of container exchange moves, and ideally modest buffers included in the sea legs between ports. The clear advantages of this model are that shippers can make long-term supply decisions and ports and terminals schedule and balance their resources to meet expected demand. With a well-planned and well-ex- ecuted pro forma schedule, higher levels of reliability and predictability can be achieved, which is advanta- geous for more effective supply chain operations and planning as containerships will spend around 15 to 20 percent of their total full rotation time in ports, with the balance being spent at sea. Reduced port time can al- low ship operators to reduce vessel speed between port calls, thereby conserving fuel, reducing emissions, and lowering costs in the process. Conversely, for every unplanned additional hour in port or at anchorage, the ships will need to increase speed to maintain the schedule, resulting in increased fuel consumption, costs, and emissions. In extreme The approach and meThodoloGy | 18

cases, ships that fall many hours behind their pro forma schedule will start to arrive at ports outside of their agreed windows, causing berth availability challenges for ports and terminals, particularly those with high berth utilization rates. This, in turn, can cause delays to shipments and disruption to supply chains. A service recovery can involve significantly higher sailing speeds, increasing fuel consumption, emissions, and costs, or the omission of a port or ports from the standard rotation, disrupting supply chains and often resulting in additional contingency costs. Time is valuable for stakeholders, and so it is logical to measure port performance based upon the total amount of time ships are required to spend in port. The CPPI 2021 has been developed based on total port time in the manner explained in subsequent sections. This second iteration utilizes data from the full calendar year of 2021. The construction of the CPPI 2021 has employed the same two approaches as the earlier edition, an administrative approach and a statistical approach, to ensure that the resulting ranking of container port performance reflects as closely as possible actual port performance, whilst also being statistically robust. The approaches are discussed in this chapter, with further detail on the statistical methodology provided in appendix B. The results are presented in chapter 3. The Anatomy of a Port Call Every container ship port call can be broken down into six distinct steps. These individual steps are illus- trated in figure 2.1. “Total port hours” is defined as the total time elapsed between when a ship reaches a port (either port limits, pilot station, or anchorage zone) to when it departs from the berth having com- pleted its cargo exchange. The time expended from berth departure (all lines up) to the departure from the port limits is deliberately excluded. The justification for the exclusion is that any performance loss that pertains to departure delays, such as pilot or tug availability, readiness of the mooring gang, chan- nel access and water depths, ship readiness, and so on, will be incurred while the ship is still alongside. Additional time resulting from these causes will, therefore, be captured when the clock stops at berth departure. 19 | The approach and meThodoloGy

Ships may spend additional time in a port after the departure from a berth, but the time associated with these additional activities is excluded from the CPPI. Ships may dwell within a port’s limits for reasons that include bunkering, repairs, or simply waiting in safe areas if unable to berth on earliest arrival at the next port. Except for bunkering not being performed simultaneously with cargo operations, these causes of additional port time are not necessarily reflective of efficiency or poor performance of the port and hence are excluded from the CPPI. None of these causes of additional port time are reflective of port inefficiency per se but delay on the part of the clearance authorities can lead to a delay in first lift and idle time after cargo operations have been completed. However, the available data are insufficiently granular to see the root causes of de- lays. The presumption is that the percentage of ships that idle alongside the berth after completion of cargo operations for reasons unrelated to port performance is modest, and their continued inclusion will not have any significant effect on the CPPI result. The other four components of the port call can logically be grouped into two distinct blocks of time. The first comprises elapsed time between ‘Arrival Anchorage, Arrival Port Limits’ and ‘All Lines fast’ (steps one to two in figure 2, the Anatomy of a Port Call); the second comprises time elapsed between ‘All Lines fast’ and ‘All Lines Up’ (steps two to five, also commonly referred to as ‘on-berth time’ or ‘berth hours’). The logic behind this division is that while there will always need to be time consumed between steps two and five, the bulk of time between steps one and two, excluding actual sailing time, is waiting time that could be completely eliminated. The approach and meThodoloGy | 20

The issue of waiting time in the measurement of port performance. Waiting time, defined as the period between ‘Arrival Port Limits’ or when the ship enters an anchorage zone, and ‘All Lines fast’ is generally regarded as pure waste. As such, in the construction of the CPPI, one possibility was to apply a penalty to waiting time. The decision was taken not to, as the introduction of a penalty of this type was seen as a normative judgement which is inconsistent with the overarching objective of producing an objective quantitative index. The 2021 data set has been enhanced since the initial CPPI 2020 was published. Great effort has been undertaken to critically review all anchorage geo-fencing, with a host of enhance- ments being made to the AIS data collection and processing. As a result, there is a significant increase in global average in-port hours, across all ports. for ports with high anchorage times, this will result in a lower ranking in 2021 as all ‘port time’ is being captured. There was a related deliberation on whether to apply a “discount” to waiting time for the smallest segment of ships. This arises because ships with less than 1,500 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of nominal capacity spend notably more time waiting at some hub ports than all other ship size seg- ments (see figure 2.2). The disparity could exist because larger ships generally enjoy a higher priority for berthing. It could also be partly explained as being a consequence of the practice of feeder ships waiting for cargo to become available, close to where they expect that demand to materialize. Neither circumstance is linked to port performance. This disparity is not as prevalent in the CPPI 2021 data but remains a small issue at some hubs (see table 2.1).

Note: TEU = twenty-foot equivalent unit. Since it is not possible to see from the data whether waiting time is voluntary or forced, it is difficult to find a suitable level at which to discount waiting time in this scenario. Since port calls of ships with less than 1,500 TEUs of capacity comprise just 10 percent of total calls in the CPPI, any impact to the overall CPPI of the disparity in waiting times between ships with less than 1,500 TEUs of nominal capacity and other segments is expected to be very slight. The same issue with respect to this being a normative judgment inconsistent with an objective quantitative index also applied. The Port Performance Program The data used to compile the CPPI is from S&P Global’s Port Performance Program. The program was started in 2009 with the goal of supporting efficiency improvements in container port operations and to support projects to optimize container port calls. The program includes 11 of the world’s largest liner shipping companies that collectively operate close to 80 percent of global fleet capacity. The liner shipping companies provide the program with a series of operational time stamps for each individual port call. The data are provided monthly and cover the full global networks of each liner ship- ping company and their subsidiary shipping companies. In 2021, performance time stamp data were captured for 164,500 port calls involving 257.4 million container moves at 826 container terminals in 443 ports worldwide. following receipt from the shipping lines, the port call data undergo an automated validation and quality checking process before mapping to AIS vessel movements data. This enables tracking and verification of the shipping line data. The geo-fencing of port and terminal zones within the AIS system supports the creation of several of the productivity metrics tracked in the program. Most of the port performance metrics are constructed from the combined AIS and liner shipping data. The metrics consist primarily of time components cross-referenced with workload achieved, either in the form of move counts or a specific task within the container port call process. Time stamps, defini- tions, and methods to calculate metrics have been fully standardized in collaboration with the shipping line partners in the program. The approach and meThodoloGy | 22

The Automatic Identification System and Port Zoning AIS technology is used to track and monitor vessels in near real time. It sends information on a vessel’s movement, speed, direction, and other particulars via satellite and terrestrial stations. The system’s function as a localized service, and indeed global tracking, was in the first place considered secondary. The primary function of AIS is as a navigational safety aid, to ensure safety and efficiency of navigation, safety of life at sea, and maritime environmental protection.1 AIS was designed for the avoidance of vessel collision, as outlined in the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention.2 All ships of net tonnage of at least 300 gross register tonnage (GRT) performing international voyag- es, all cargo ships of at least 500 GRT not performing international voyages, and all passenger ships, regardless of size, should be equipped with AIS. This allows vessels to automatically transfer data and a plethora of navigational and identification information to other nearby ships and to relevant port au- thorities in the form of structured messages.3 The technical requirements for AIS are specified by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Recommendation ITU-R M.1371-5(02/2014).4 for maritime domain awareness and safety purposes, the use of continuous 24/7, near real time, on- line AIS data makes it possible to monitor areas, vessels, and routes; generate shore-based alerts; and provide useful positional and navigational information in general (IALA 2005). Satellite-based AIS receivers offer coverage outside the land-based antennas’ range by covering the whole globe from pole to pole. Satellite AIS coverage can extend to the entire exclusive economic zone (EEZ) or globally, including remote coastal areas (IALA 2016). In the case of ports,5 the usage of “zones” helps in recording a vessel’s navigational status and posi- tioning. AIS zones offer different indicators activated automatically by the vessel’s signal reporting its position. Every port has at least one zone that is created in a way that captures the arrivals and sailings of vessels at cargo-handling facilities but avoids spurious reports being recorded from passing traffic. Where a subject port is geographically spread out with terminals located remotely, it is likely that there will be more than one zone with all zones linked by a standard port identification number. Ports that straddle a river or other similar body of water will often have zones along opposing shorelines with a track separating them, thus avoiding the capture of AIS reports from traffic navigating through a fairway or channel. Once again, the individual zones will be linked to their common port using the port’s unique identification number. Zones also cover anchorages recording vessels having arrived around a port but awaiting authority to enter, or vessels laid up awaiting orders. Additional zones cover the arrival of vessels at repair yards or those navigating locks. Anchorage zones may be created on an ad hoc basis. Not all ports have anchorage areas and of those that do, not all are shown in nautical charts. Whenever possible, S&P Global uses its own tracking and observation tools to determine where vessels anchor and create zones accordingly. Each anchorage zone is linked to the relevant port using the subject port’s unique identification number. AIS is a reliable tool of high standards, but it also has its flaws which can have an impact on transmission and quality of data being captured. Some of the issues that may affect the signal could be either due to the AIS transponder being deliberately turned off, problematic reception, high traffic density areas, weather conditions, or anomalous positions. 23 | The approach and meThodoloGy

The Construction of the CPPI for a port to qualify for inclusion in the CPPI it must have registered at least 20 valid port calls where port hours can be calculated within the full calendar year. Of the 444 ports from which IHS Markit received port call information, 370 are included in the main index of CPPI 2021. There were 163,852 distinct port calls recorded in the data over this time period.

An average of around 60 percent of total port time is consumed by container-handling operations. As figure 2.4 shows, the ratio of time spent on handling operations increases as ship size increases, driven by larger call sizes. Call size does not affect the amount of time spent on arrival, start, and finish pro- cesses. These processes are, however, influenced by ship size. Mooring operations and lashing com- pletion generally take longer on larger ships, although this is somewhat offset by larger ships potentially enjoying a slightly higher priority and assignment of resources. A correlation of close to 60 percent is observed between call size and crane intensity (CI) using a logarithmic trend line. As figure 2.5 shows, CI increases rapidly through smaller call sizes and starts to peak and flatten when call sizes reach 4,000 to 6,000 moves per call. With a maximum observed CI of around nine cranes per ship, it is interesting to note that for calls exceeding 11,000 moves, CI is always below 6.0. This is a global representation, and most of the call sizes in excess of 11,000 moves occur on North America’s west coast, where ports have multiple terminals, each with a limited quantity of cranes (crane density), and where the deployment of additional cranes is generally considered to be cost pro- hibitive. Above and beyond crane density will be factors relating to how close together adjacent cranes can operate. There can also be some constraints from the stowage plan if an excessively intense area of work is concentrated in one part of the ship.

Average call size increases as ship size increases, but not proportionately with ship size (see figure 2.6). This result is partially influenced by the deployment trends and dynamics of the liner shipping networks, and the capacity and volume of a particular port. for example, a ship of 20,000 TEU capacity will likely be deployed on the Asia-North Europe trade lane and make more than 12 port calls per rotation. On the other hand, a ship of 14,000 TEUs deployed on the transpacific route would likely serve just eight ports in a full rotation. If all rotations had an equal quantity of port calls, then call size and ship size would trend proportionately, assuming that (1) a port can physically handle larger vessels; and (2) there are a sufficient number of containers to be loaded and unloaded to justify a stop by a vessel of that size.

The gross crane productivity by ship size group displayed in figure 2.7 is a global average across all ports. There is limited variation in average gross crane productivity performance for ship size groups including and larger than 1,501 to 5,000 TEUs of capacity. Average gross crane productivity is lower for the smallest ship size group, albeit by around only 6 percent versus the average of all. A different result might have been expected because height and out-trolley distances are greater on larger ships. However, the additional cycle time necessitated by the greater distances is likely compensated for by a larger quantity of moves per bay and more moves per hatch-cover move and gantry position. Smaller ships also tend to suffer more from trim and list in port and generally deploy poorer lashing systems. This would further account for the slightly lower performance that is observed. Analysis of CI and productivity shows that CI has a major impact on operating time and by extension 60 percent of total port time. It is evident, therefore, that both ship and call size segments need to be reflected in the construction of the CPPI for it to be realistic. When comparing port performance and efficiency, it is necessary to take note of and account for the extent of this impact. This can be done in two ways: by applying a weighting by call size, or by examin- ing performance within call size groups that are narrow enough to effectively neutralize the influence of call size and CI. After extensively testing both methods, we find the former can generate some volatile results when applied across a broad range of ports and ship sizes, and, therefore, chose the latter as being the more reliable for the CPPI methodology. 27 | The approach and meThodoloGy

Call Size Group There is also a progressive increasing trend in CI as we move through the call size groups (see figure 2.8). This trend peaks and flattens once we pass the 6,000 moves per call range, leading to the pre- sumption that CI does not have a major influence when call size exceeds 6,000 moves per call.

In order to assess the sensitivity within each call size group across all 370 qualifying ports, the medi- an call size between all ports within a call size group was taken and a tolerance range of 15 percent above and below the median created (see table 2.2). In the six call size groups from the 1,001–1,500 to 4,001–6,000 moves groups, more than 97 percent of ports have an average call size well within this tolerance range. When one goes beyond the threshold of 6,000 moves per call, call size has much less of an impact on CI (see figure 2.8). This is because the number of cranes that can be deployed is limited by the overall number of cranes available or stowage splits. The quantity of ports with an average call size within the tolerance range in the three smallest call size groups is not as high as the quantity in the six call size groups from the 1,001–1,500 to 4,001–6,000 moves groups. However, for those ports with an average call size above the tolerance range, it would ordinarily be possible to increase CI to match the slightly higher call sizes, and, therefore, the conclusion is that they are not being penalized unfairly. There is a practical consideration and that is the desire to keep to a workable number of call size groups. A workable number of call size groups ensure that the data are not overly diluted, and so addi- tional call size groups for below 1,000 moves per call have not been created. After examining multiple options, an efficiency comparison based on these 10 defined call size groups was found to be both objective and relevant, whilst neutralizing the influence of call size and CI. The application of ship size groups is less important than call size groups, particularly once the call data is already split into 10 call size groups. However, one objective of the CPPI is to highlight through comparison the performance gaps and, therefore, opportunities to save fuel and reduce emissions. The analysis should, therefore, account for the fact that the larger the ship, the more fuel it consumes, and the higher the potential opportunity to save fuel and reduce emissions. Therefore, we introduce five different ship size groups into the CPPI methodology. five ship size groups (see table 2.3) are considered to be the optimum number of ship size groups to account for the fact that larger ships use more fuel, without overly diluting the data. The groups are defined based upon clustering similar classes of container ships together and to the greatest extent possible the trade lanes where they would generally be deployed. The typology is based on nominal TEU capacity, but it would be equally effective to categorize based on GRT or length overall. 29 | The approach and meThodoloGy

Some intra-regional services will also have ships in this size range. A vast quantity of these classic Panamax ships are deployed on intra-regional trades. They are found on Intra-Asian trades and north-south trades to and from Africa, Latin America, and Oceania, as well as Transatlantic services. Vessels within this size group are mainly deployed on the north-south trade lanes. Vessel cascading and improving port capabilities has seen them start to emerge as stock vessels for Africa and Latin America, as well as Oceania, trades. There is some presence on transatlantic and Asia–Middle East trades as well. These Neo-Panamax vessels are largely deployed on east-west trades, partic- ularly transpacific, both to North America’s west coast as well as via either the Panama or Suez Canals to North America’s east coast. They also feature on Asia–Middle East trades, with some deployed on Asia–Mediterranean rotations. These ultra-large container ships (ULCS) are mainly deployed on Asia–Europe (serving both North Europe and the Mediterranean) and Asia–United States trades, especially on transpacific services calling at North America’s west coast ports.

Some 44 percent of all calls in the database were made by ships with a capacity of between 1,500 and 5,000 TEUs. The other two mid-range ship size bands are also well represented. As expected, there is a lower concentration of calls in the smallest and largest ship size bands. Nevertheless, there is still a sufficiently high quantity of data for representative benchmarking in the smallest and largest ship size bands (see figure 2.9).

Some of the other call size bands within ship size ranges contain limited data but they are considered sufficient for inclusion and analysis. Data for each ship size group is extracted from the full data set, and then broken down into average hours consumed within each call size group at each port. Total port hours are broken down into arrival hours (defined as elapsed time from arrival port limits to all lines fast) and berth hours (defined as all lines fast to all lines released). With 43 potential ship and call size combinations per qualifying port, there will naturally be many combinations where no actual data exist. The objective of preparing the index and the ranking is that it should reflect as closely as possible actual port performance, whilst also being statistically robust. With respect to the largest ports—the top 100 ports by annual move count—there is real empirical data present in each of the 43 distinct ship size and call size categories. However, for smaller ports there are many categories with no data, particularly those with only a few hundred calls in total. If these unpopulated categories are ignored, the appraisal of performance would be undertaken on different quantities of categories, which is likely to unduly disadvantage smaller ports that might well be quite efficient despite their modest size and throughput. Imputing missing values: the administrative approach Addressing this undeserved handicap is approached in two different ways: an administrative approach and a statistical approach. In the case of the former, the approach involved assigning values to empty categories based upon data that are available when a port has registered a data point within a specific ship size range. 31 | The approach and meThodoloGy

Ideally, this is a mid-range call size group because the lowest and highest groups demonstrate some uniqueness. In cases where there is no actual data for the base call size group, the next highest group is examined to find an actual data set. If none is found, then the approach involves looking at the immediately lower call size band. At the end of this exercise, every port has a value pres- ent for the base call size group. Imputing vessel arrival values. Where any call size group does not have an arrival hours value, it is pop- ulated by using the overall average arrival time for all vessels registered at that port across all call size groups within each specific ship size group. This is logical as call size is less of a determinant of waiting time than ship size. Imputing berth hours. from the base call size group, moving left toward the lowest group and right toward the highest group, in groups where no value exists, a value is determined on a pro rata basis given the adjacent call size group value, actual data or imputed. The rationale is that if within one call size group a port had either higher or lower berth hours than the average, it is most probable that would be the case in the adjacent call size group as well. Table 2.6 contains an illustrative example. In this case, port A had a higher quantity of hours in the base call size group than the group average. It is assumed that would also have been the case had the port registered actual calls in the 501–1,000 and 1,501–2,000 call size groups. The opposite is true for port B, which achieved a lower quantity of hours in the base call size group. The calculation for port A in the 501–1,000 call size group is actual hours within the group 1,001–1,500 (12.0) multiplied by the group average factor (0.9) for a prorated quantity of average berth hours of (10.8).

The inherent risk with this approach is that poor or good performance within just one group will cascade across all call size groups. It also assumes that a port’s ability to add cranes to larger call size groups exists, which might not be true in all cases. On the other hand, it would be illogical to blindly assume that any port would simply achieve the average of the entire group or, possibly worse, to assume that a port performing below average in one call size group would miraculously perform much better than average in others where it did not record any actual calls. Imputing missing values: the statistical approach A more sophisticated approach is using a likelihood-based method to impute those missing values. With respect of the current data set, the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm can be utilized to provide a maximum-likelihood estimator for each missing value. This approach relies on two critical assumptions: The first one is that the missing values are random, that is, it is not due to some bias in the sample selection; and the second one is that the variables under consideration are all normally distributed. These assumptions are not considered unrealistic in the context of the data set. EM then computes the maximum likelihood estimator for the mean and variance of the normal distribution given the observed data. knowing the distribution that generates the missing data, one can then sample from it to impute the missing values.6 Constructing the index: the administrative approach Aggregating arrival and berth hours into total port hours. This report indicated earlier that a case could be made for penalizing waiting time which is regarded as pure waste. However, as expressed earlier, this would be a normative judgment, accordingly both arrival and berth hours are weighted as 1.0 and the two time segments are summed to form total port hours in CPPI 2021. Appraising port hours performance. Average port hours are naturally higher in the larger than smaller call size groups. This can magnify the difference in hours between a subject port and the average port hours of the overall group. So, appraising on the difference between a port’s average hours and aver- age hours of the group may skew the scoring unduly toward the larger call size calls. There are also far fewer calls within the larger than smaller call size groups, and this also needs to be reflected in the construction of the CPPI to retain maximum objectivity. The method applied to each call size group individually is that the port’s average port hours is com- pared with the group’s average port hours as a negative or positive quantity of hours. The result of that comparison is weighted by the ratio of port calls in each call size group for the entire group of ports Table 2.7 provides an illustration as to how it is done.7 TABLE 2.7. • Port Hours Performance Appraisal PORT PORT HOURS HOURS DIFFERENCE CALL SIZE GROUP WEIGHT RESULT Example Port Group Average 22.56 34.65 12.09 0.160 1.9344 Source: Original table produced for this publication, based on CPPI 2021 data. In this illustrative example, the subject port used 12.09 fewer hours than the average of the entire group (22.56 versus 34.65). Since 16.0 percent of all port calls in this ship size group were in the subject call size 33 | The approach and meThodoloGy

group, the difference in hours (12.09) is multiplied by ratio 0.160 for an overall index points result of 1.9344. Where a port uses more port time than the average for all ports, the index points become negative. Aggregation to a score and rank per ship size group. The “results” achieved per port within each of the 10 call size groups are then summed together to calculate a score within the overall ship size group (it is five and eight groups rather than 10 groups in the case of the two smaller ship size groups, respec- tively). Based upon these scores, there is a sub-ranking performed within each ship size group that can be reviewed in the final CPPI rankings. However, the imputation method might unfairly appraise some ports that only recorded data within a few call size groups. If, for example, the performance in a few call size groups was worse than the aver- age for all ports within the ship size group, this would be prorated to all call size groups. This required a judgment, as the alternative of ignoring call size groups without actual data, effectively resulting in a zero score for those groups, would not necessarily result in a better outcome. In the latter case, ports with limited call size diversity would not be credited with positive scores in each and every call size group which they are likely to have achieved if they had a greater diversity of call sizes. Aggregating all ship size groups No allowance was made for ports that did not handle ships within specific ship size groups during the period under consideration. The quantity of ports being included per ship size group was presented earlier in table 2.5. The primary reason is many of the smaller ports are not capable of handling some of the larger ship sizes and so would in effect be awarded positive (or negative) results for scenarios that are physically impossible. The omission of scores within some ship size groups would only be an issue if an attempt was made to compare the performance of major mainline ports with those of far smaller ports. But this is a comparison that is neither fair nor valuable. for the comparison between similarly sized ports, this factor will not contribute, or at least not significant- ly. In aggregating the scores from the various ship size groups into the overall CPPI in the administrative approach, a factor was built in to differentiate the importance and significance of better performance of larger ships over smaller ones. This was constructed based on the relative fuel consumption (and, therefore, emissions and cost) of different ship sizes in the form of an index (see table 2.8). for each ship size group, a typical mid-range example ship was selected. Based upon the expected deployment of such ships, a range of sea legs were defined (and weighted), at a typical pro forma service speed, and the impact on fuel consumption that one hour longer (or shorter) in port would be likely to yield.

The total aggregated index points per port within each ship size group are then weighted by this “cost” factor. The sum of the weighted index points for each port across all five ship size groups are then summed and the final CPPI ranking is based upon those weighted values. The primary focus was micro-delays and it was assumed that these would be recovered on long-haul ocean legs, and not between coastal ports, which would be more costly. Through simulation, if the 35 | The approach and meThodoloGy

index values are tweaked up or down by up to 10 percent the overall ranking is unaffected. If they are adjusted so that larger ship size groups have lower indices than smaller ones it results in radical chang- es to the overall ranking. To achieve a final CPPI score and ranking in the administrative approach, accumulated results within each ship size group are multiplied by the index values per ship size group and then summed. The ranking is then based in descending order on final summed totals across all ship size groups. The resulting index for main and secondary ports using the administrative approach is presented in chapter 3 and appendix A. Constructing the index: the statistical approach An alternative approach to construct an index of container port performance is to use a statistical tech- nique such as factor analysis (fA). The advantage of fA is that it can be used to examine a large data set and ascertain the impact of a series of measured variables on an unseen latent variable (for example, in this case of efficiency), which cannot be measured directly with a single variable. Instead, it is seen via the relationships it has with a series of visible and measurable variables, each of which contains information about the “efficiency” of the port. The latent variable, efficiency, is a function of each of the measured variables, and an error term for each. fA then determines the relative weight to be attached to each of the measured variables vis-à-vis the efficiency of the port, together with some uncertainty, which is captured by the error terms. At the level of the individual port, the measured variables include the average time expended for the different stages, under various categories—(1) different call size bands; and (2) berth/port-to-berth. The actual values of these variables are determined by a small number of unobserved factors, such as the availability and quality of the infrastructure, the layout of the port, the expertise of the employees, the available depth in the channel and at the berth, and so on. The challenge is that we cannot observe these latent factors and how they contribute to the impact on the measured variable, and ultimately on the latent variable. A simple example may be illustrative: Suppose we have three ports and for each port we have four different types of time cost, as shown in table 2.9. TABLE 2.9. • Simple Illustration of Latent factors PORT COST 1 COST 2 COST 3 COST 4 A B C 1 2 3 2 4 6 3 6 9 4 8 12 Source: Original table produced for this publication. As one can observe from table 2.9, costs 2 to 4 are just some multiples of cost 1. Although we have four variables, to rank the efficiency of these three ports, just one variable is enough (A>B>C). This is an extreme case, but the idea can be generalized if these variables are somehow correlated, but to a less extreme extent. In that case, the factors are computed as some linear combination of costs 1 to 4. Of course, if costs 1 to 4 are completely independent of each other, then this method makes no sense. fortunately, this is not the case for our data set. Thus, for each port, we can compute its score on all factors and then combine those scores together to reach a final efficiency score. The approach and meThodoloGy | 36

Note that in the statistical approach using fA, the scores are not calculated for each call size range. On the contrary, the whole data set, including the smaller ports, is used simultaneously to obtain latent factors. This is in sharp contrast to the administrative approach. The statistical approach factors in all the correlations among hours for various call size bands, which purely from a statistical perspective is more efficient. Although one downside of this approach is that fA does not consider that some observations might be more reliable than others as they are based on more calls. This implies the results, and poten- tially the ranking, for some of the ports could be distorted in the presence of large outliers. There is no right or wrong methodology, but the two different approaches that are considered comple- mentary. Hence, the decision in the inaugural edition of the CPPI to use both approaches, to try and ensure that the resulting ranking(s) of container port performance reflects as closely as possible actual port performance, whilst also being statistically robust. Chapter 3 presents the CPPI 2021 from both approaches, explaining divergences, where possible.

3. The container p ort performance index 2021 Introduction The CPPI 2021 has been developed based on total port time in the manner explained in the previous sec- tions. The rationale of using two methodologies, as explained earlier, is to ensure that the ranking reflects as closely as possible actual port performance, whilst also being statistically robust. This second edition utilizes data up to the end of 2021. The resulting rankings of container port performance, based on the two different approaches, are presented in this chapter. The following section presents the rankings for the top 100 best performing container ports, with the full rankings of all ports by both approaches presented alphabetically in appendix A. The subse- quent sections present a summary by region and by throughput, so ports in the same region, or with the same throughput, within broad categories can be compared. The CPPI 2021 Table 3.1 presents the rankings of container port performance in the CPPI 2021, which resulted from using both the statistical and administrative approaches. The ranking and score in the left-hand columns are results from the administrative approach; the ranking and score in the right-hand columns show results from the statistical approach. The index points used to construct the ranking in the administrative approach reflect the approach as outlined in the chapter explaining the methodology, which is an aggregate of the performance The conTainer porT performance index 2021 | 38

of the port, weighted relative to the average, across call and vessel size (see table A.1 in appendix A for the detailed rankings produced by the administrative approach). Accordingly, the scores can be nega- tive, where a port compares poorly to the average in one call size and vessel size category, particularly if it does not have an offsetting positive score or scores in other cells. The use of matrix factorization also results in a statistic (a total score/index value) that is the sum of a weighted average of indices for each of the same five vessel sizes.1 The indices for each vessel size are estimated based on the time expired in the port, and a number of unknown factors, or latent variables (see appendix B for a more detailed explanation of the approach), which have an impact on perfor- mance, but cannot be seen. The resulting index values have both positive and negative values. Intui- tively, the highest positive index value is allocated to the best performing port, while the most negative value is assigned to the port with the worst performance. The two top-ranked container ports in the CPPI 2021 are king Abdullah Port (Saudi Arabia) in first place, followed by the Port of Salalah (Oman) in second place. These two ports occupy the same positions in the rankings generated by both approaches. king Abdullah Port was ranked second in both ap- proaches in CPPI 2020. The Port of Salalah ranked sixth and ninth in the statistical and administrative approaches, respectively, for CPPI 2020. Of the top 10 ranked ports, all have improved their position since CPPI 2020, with Jeddah and Hamad Port moving 35 and 34 positions in the ranking, respectively. The exceptions are Yokohama, which has fallen from first place in both in 2020, to 10th and 12th in CPPI 2021, and Guangzhou, which dropped from sixth to ninth place. There are 37 new entrants to the CPPI 2021, and a number of significant movers in terms of their ranking since the CPPI 2020. One hundred and forty-nine ports improved their rankings in CPPI 2021, compared to CPPI 2020, with some of the largest improvers increasing their ranking by more than 200 positions. By contrast, the ranking of 182 ports fell in the CPPI 2021, over the inaugural edition, with some of the largest movers falling nearly 300 positions, reflecting the challenges faced by ports during the period of interest.

The CPPI 2021 also displays a marked reduction in the discrepancies between the two approaches compared to CPPI 2020. In CPPI 2020, just under 18 percent of all ports (61 ports) were ranked within three places or less from themselves in the dual rankings. In CPPI 2021, 38 percent of all ports (139 ports) are ranked within three places or less from themselves in the dual rankings (a 20 percent im- provement). Approximately 40 percent (137 ports) were ranked within 10 places or less of themselves in the CPPI 2020. CPPI 2021 registered 267 ports (72 percent) that were ranked within 10 places or less of themselves, a 32 percent improvement on CPPI 2020 rankings. In CPPI 2021, the first 20 ports and final 20 ports are within an average of one place from themselves in the dual rankings. Ranking by Region This section presents the results of the 370 ports in the CPPI 2021 by region. One of the requested amendments to CPPI 2020 was to tabulate the results and rankings by region and by throughput, to allow easier comparison with ports in the region, but also with ports with a similar throughput. This section offers a summary tabulation of the results and ranking (see table 3.2 onward) by the following defined regions: The conTainer porT performance index 2021 | 48

Conclusions and Next Steps The rationale behind the CPPI was to use available empirical data to create an objective measure to compare container port performance across ports, and eventually over time. The intention was to, in a comparable manner, identify gaps and opportunities for improvement that will ultimately benefit all stakeholders, from shipping lines to national governments to consumers. The CPPI is intended to serve as a key reference point for stakeholders in the global economy, including national governments, port authorities and operators, development agencies, supranational organizations, various maritime inter- ests, and other public and private stakeholders in trade, logistic, and supply chain services. Looking to the future, the intention is that the CPPI will continue to be refined in subsequent editions, reflecting stakeholder feedback, improvement in data scope and quality, and additional analysis of trends. The World Bank-S&P Global Market Intelligence team will continue to refine the methodologies; the scope, where possible increasing the number of ports; and the data. The next iteration (CPPI 2022) will be comparable, facilitating analysis of trends in container port performance, both overall and poten- tially by disaggregation by ship or call size. The CPPI 2022 will also seek to remove the divergences between the two approaches, whilst gaining a further understanding of key determinants or influences on container port performance. The overall objective remains the identification of opportunities for improvement to ultimately benefit all public and private stakeholders, including ports, shipping lines, governments, line agencies, businesses, and consumers.

appendix b: constructing the cppi with matrix factorization The Structure of the Data Before discussing the methodology employed in constructing the CPPI with matrix factorization, it is helpful to first summarize the structure of available data. The data set contains the following five cate- gories of ship size: z z z z z feeders: <1,500 TEUs Intra-regional: 1,500–5,000 TEUs Intermediate: 5,000–8,500 TEUs Neo-Panamax: 8,500–13,500 TEUs Ultra-large container carriers: >13,500 TEUs for each category, there are 10 different bands for call size. The port productivity is captured by av- erage idle hour, which consists of two parts: port-to-berth (PB) and on-berth (B). In the previous CPPI iteration, total variables used = 5 x 10 x 2. Of course, many of them have missing values. The objective is to build a model to summarize these variables and then construct a port productivity index for all appendix b: consTrucTinG The cppi wiTh maTrix facTorizaTion | 90

ports under consideration. The average waiting time and average berth time is calculated for each call size. The resulting data is a table/matrix whose rows represent ports and whose columns contain the average waiting and berth times of each call size. Imputation of Missing Values A major practical problem is that most idle hour variables have a significant number of missing values. for instance, in the port performance data set the two smaller ship sizes contain very little data for the larger call sizes. Consequently, as in the administrative approach, the call size groups with more than 2,000 moves were removed from the <1,500 TEU ship category, and the call size groups with more than 4,000 moves were removed from the 1,501–5,000 TEU ship category. A more sophisticated approach is to use likelihood-based methods to impute those missing values. for the current data set, expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm can be utilized to provide a maxi- mum-likelihood estimator for each missing value. It relies on two critical assumptions. The first assump- tion is that gaps are random, or more specifically, the gaps are not caused by sample selection bias. The second assumption is that all variables under consideration follow a normal distribution. Given the data set, these two assumptions are plausible. EM computes the maximum likelihood estimator for the mean and variance of the normal distribution given the observed data. knowing the distribution that gener- ates the missing data, we can then sample from it to impute the missing values. Matrix factorization can then be performed on the resulting data set, instead of the original one filled with missing values. Missing values in the resulting table/matrix are reconstructed using the EM algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977). A non-negativity constraint is added to make sure the reconstructed times are non-neg- ative. Assuming the data has a multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean vector µ and covariance matrix ∑, the EM algorithm provides an estimate of the two parameters µ and ∑ via maximum likelihood. Missing values are imputed using their conditional expectation. In this approach, given a row with avail- able values and missing values , the missing values are imputed by their conditional expectation given the available data, where the expected value is computed only over the non-negative values of to ensure the imputed values are non-negative. In this iteration, arrival and berth hours are aggregated into total port hours, just like in the administra- tive approach. The data structure after this aggregation for a particular category k (k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) can be summarized as shown in table B.1. TABLE B.1. • Sample Port Productivity Data Structure, by Ship Size CALL SIZE BAND (NUMBER OF MOVES) 251–500 …... >6,000 Total Port Port-to- Hours Berth Berth Total Port Hours Port-to- Berth Berth Total Port Hours SHIP SIZE (K) Ports Port-to- Berth <250 Berth 1 2 3 . . .

Why Is Matrix Factorization Useful? Essentially, for each port, quite a few variables contain information about its efficiency. These include average time cost under various categories: (1) different call size bands, and (2) berth/port-to-berth. The reason matrix factorization can be helpful is that these variables are in fact determined by a small number of unobserved factors, which might include quality of infrastructure, expertise of staff, and so on. Depending on the data, very few of such factors can summarize almost all useful information. The challenge lies in the inability to observe those latent factors; however, a simple example could be help- ful: Imagine three ports, each with four different types of time cost, as shown in table B.2. TABLE B.2. • Simple Illustration of Latent factors PORT COST 1 COST 2 COST 3 COST 4 A B C 1 2 3 2 4 6 3 6 9 4 8 12 Source: Original table produced for this publication. As one can observe, costs 2 to 4 are just some multiples of cost 1. Although we have four variables, to rank the efficiency of these three ports, just one variable is enough (A>B>C). This is an extreme case, but the idea can be generalized if these variables are somehow correlated, but to a less extreme extent. In that case, the factors are computed as some linear combination of costs 1 to 4. Of course, if costs 1 to 4 are completely independent of each other, then this method makes no sense. fortunately, this is not the case for our data set. Thus, for each port, we can compute its score on all factors and then combine those scores together to reach a final efficiency score. Note that in the statistical approach using matrix factorization, the scores are not calculated for each call size range. On the contrary, the whole data set, including the smaller ports, is used simultaneously to obtain latent factors. This is in sharp contrast to the administrative approach. The statistical approach factors in all the correlations among hours for various call size bands, which purely from a statistical perspective is more efficient. There is no right or wrong methodology, but the two different approaches that are considered comple- mentary. Hence, the decision in this iteration of the CPPI to maintain both approaches, to try and ensure that the resulting ranking(s) of container port performance reflects as closely as possible actual port performance, whilst also being statistically robust. The Statistical Methodology The data are scaled and weighted as in the administrative approach. z z z Let denote average port time of port i in call size j. Let denote the average of the average port time of all ports in the given call size. Let denote the ratio of port calls that are in the call size group j. The conTainer porT performance index 2021 | 92

z The data are scaled by replacing by A positive value of means the port is doing better than average, whereas a negative value means it is doing worse than average. Let x = denote the resulting matrix of scaled port time. Assume x has n rows (n ports) and p columns (p call size bands). Instead of using factor analysis as in the previous iteration, the matrix x is decomposed as x ≈ WH where W is a n×k matrix and H is an entrywise non-negative k ×p matrix. The integer k (the number of columns of W) is chosen to be a small number to compress the data. The matrix W represents factors and the matrix H factor loadings that are used to explain the data x. A number of k = 3 factors was found to be adequate to approximate the data matrix x. Note: In the previous iteration, a factor analysis (fA) approach was used. The fA produces a matrix fac- torization x ≈ WH as above, except that the matrix H does not need to be non-negative. This is a prob- lem since a large positive factor does not necessarily represent a small port time if the corresponding loading is negative. The new approach fixes that problem by enforcing non-negativity in the loadings matrix H. This approach produces results that are consistent with the administrative approach. The CPPI for each ship size is obtained by adding the three columns of W. The CPPI index is a weighted sum of these indices: Let CPPIi denote the CPPI index for ship size i (i = 1, . . . ,5). where (α1, α2, α3, α4, α5) = (0.46, 1.00, 1.54, 1.97, 2.57).
