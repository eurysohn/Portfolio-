Introduction In an era of global volatility, businesses are waking up to a hard truth: supply chains are no longer just cost centers or operational functions—they are strategic assets, risk multipliers, and reputational accelerators. This report, based on aggregated MESH self-assessment data and market insights, identifies trends in maturity, investment patterns, and strategic gaps. It also makes the case for embedding resilience into every corner of the enterprise—from procurement to IT, logistics to legal, and from boardrooms to the front lines. Supply chains are no longer invisible. Their weaknesses are in full view. The next phase of competitive advantage will belong to organizations that recognize resilience as a shared responsibility—and a catalyst for growth. The MESH Supply Chain Resilience Report 2025 examines the maturity of supply chain risk and resilience programs across industries, using data collected through the MESH Maturity Assessment tool. The findings highlight how organizations are (or aren’t) adapting to disruption, where vulnerabilities persist, and what leading firms are doing differently. Despite increasing investments in digital tools and sustainability reporting, many companies remain underprepared for the rising wave of shocks—ranging from geopolitical tension and ESG scrutiny to supplier instability and climate-linked disruption. Worse still, fragmented ownership and siloed functions continue to limit organizational visibility and agility. MESH—short for Mapping, Evaluation, Strategy, and Harmonization—provides a structured framework to assess and improve an organization’s supply chain resilience across eight critical dimensions. It encourages cross-functional coordination, long-term thinking, and operational continuity. MESH Supply Chain Resilience Report 2025 ©2025 BSI. All rights reserved. 33

Executive summary This inaugural MESH Supply Chain Resilience Report brings into focus a new maturity landscape for global organizations. Drawing on hundreds of responses to the MESH Maturity Assessment, the data reveals a clear gap between intent and implementation when it comes to supply chain resilience. Key findings • Fragmented maturity: Over 60% of organizations rated themselves as Basic or Ad Hoc across key • Investment ≠ integration: Average spending on resilience initiatives is rising, but many programs remain siloed— resilience areas like supplier assurance, logistics limited to procurement or compliance functions continuity, and digital infrastructure. Just 6% achieved rather than being embedded across the business. a Leading rating in more than one dimension. • Visibility lags strategy: While 72% of respondents beyond reaction and toward integration—shifting say resilience is a priority in board-level organizations from a passive to a proactive strategy, only 38% have comprehensive supplier stance in the face of accelerating risk. • The MESH model offers a new lens to move mapping or end-to-end risk visibility. • Workforce capability is a blind spot: Less than a third of firms report regular training or defined accountability structures for supply chain risk management across departments. • Disruption fatigue is real: More than half of firms experienced a material supply chain disruption in the past 12 months. Yet fewer than 40% have updated or tested their business continuity plans in the same timeframe. This report aims to: • Benchmark current maturity levels, • Surface best practices from leading firms, • And serve as a call to action for those looking to future-proof their supply chains. The message is clear: resilient supply chains are not built during a crisis—they’re built in advance, through alignment, planning, and continuous improvement.

Supply chain risks on the rise MESH Supply Chain Resilience Report 2025 ©2025 BSI. All rights reserved. 5

A new era of exposure, complexity and disruption Key disruption factors reported: For many organizations, the past year has felt like a series of rolling disruptions. From geopolitical shocks and extreme weather events to regulatory tightening and transportation gridlocks, supply chain leaders are navigating a risk environment that is no longer cyclical – but continuous. More than half (54%) of MESH respondents reported experiencing a significant supply chain disruption in the past 12 months. Yet fewer than 1 in 3 had the systems, data, or response structures in place to mitigate the downstream impact in real time. This rise in exposure reflects not just external shocks but internal maturity gaps. Many businesses continue to treat supply chain resilience as an operational issue rather than an enterprise-level risk. 48% cite unreliable or failing suppliers as the root cause 35% point to ESG-related scrutiny and evolving compliance rules 41% 31% identify transport bottlenecks, particularly across borders experienced delays linked to workforce or contractor shortages 38% report limited upstream visibility into Tier 2+ suppliers 6

– What organizations say are their top perceived supply chain risks in 2025: Supply chain risk is no longer theoretical – it’s persistent, tangible, and rapidly evolving 1 Supplier failure/disruption 2 Regulatory or ESG non-compliance 3 Logistics and transport delayst 4 Data and system integration gaps 5 Political/geopolitical instability 63% 49% 46% 38% 34% Rank Risk catagory % of respondents Despite widespread awareness, only 29% of firms have a formal supply chain risk register. And just 22% say their risk mitigation plans are tested or updated more than once a year. The takeaway: supply chain risk is no longer theoretical—it’s persistent, tangible, and rapidly evolving. Yet many organizations remain stuck in reactive mode, limiting their ability to adapt and protect their core operations. MESH aims to change this by offering a structured, diagnostic model that helps organizations move from blind spots to benchmarks—and from exposure to resilience.

Yet most disruption. supply chain resilience gaps can be traced not to tools or technology—but to human But capability-building isn’t just about issues: lack of ownership, poor cross- formal training—it’s about creating a functional alignment, and limited capability culture of resilience: to anticipate or respond. While many organizations are investing in platforms and analytics, only 28% of MESH respondents report having • Do people understand their role in risk identification and escalation? • Are cross-functional teams engaged in continuity planning? clear accountability for supply chain • Is supply chain maturity seen as a risk embedded across business units. shared goal, or a specialist concern? Even fewer—just 21%—say that supply chain risk is regularly discussed beyond procurement or compliance teams. The gap is cultural as much as technical.

Technology is reshaping the risk landscape – but so is how we use it Supply chains are digitizing fast. AI- At the same time, risks are evolving: powered planning, IoT-enabled tracking, blockchain transparency, and predictive analytics are rapidly becoming standard. Yet, adoption alone doesn’t guarantee resilience. • AI-generated demand signals can amplify errors in forecasting. • IoT systems increase the digital attack surface. • ESG compliance platforms can In fact, 41% of MESH respondents say the flag risk – but only if connected complexity introduced by new technologies to real-time supplier data. has increased their exposure to risk—due to misalignment, undertrained teams, or integration gaps between legacy systems and modern tools. While many firms are investing in supply chain tech, fewer are aligning it with their risk and resilience goals. Technology is often deployed for cost or efficiency—less so for continuity, scenario planning, or adaptive response. Only 35% of organizations said they felt “highly confident” in the quality and integration of their supply chain data.

– “Visibility is the new currency of trust – but only when systems talk to each other and to the people who make the decisions.” – Supply Chain Digital Transformation Lead, MESH Respondent What sets digital leaders apart? Firms that score “Advanced” or “Leading” in MESH’s Digital Infrastructure and Data Integration dimension tend to: • Use real-time data in supplier risk management • Cross-reference ESG, logistics, and financial data for decision-making • Align tech investment with business continuity goals • Design systems that support scenario testing and rapid reconfiguration The lesson: resilience is not about owning the latest tech. It’s about using the right tools with the right people – connected, contextualized, and coordinated. MESH Supply Chain Resilience Report 2025 ©2025 BSI. All rights reserved. 15 15

How organizations measure up –and where the biggest gaps lie The MESH Supply Chain Maturity Assessment provides a structured, diagnostic approach to evaluating an organization’s resilience across eight interdependent dimensions. Each dimension is scored on a five-level maturity scale—from Basic to Leading—based on self-assessed practices, structures, and capabilities. The eight core dimensions: 1 Organizational Governance and Strategic Alignment 2 3 4 5 6 7 Supply Chain Visibility & Mapping Risk Management and Business Continuity Planning Supplier Assurance and Performance Management Logistics and Transportation Resilience Digital Infrastructure and Data Integration Regulatory Compliance and Ethical Standards 8 Workforce Capability and Culture MESH Supply Chain Resilience Report 2025 ©2025 BSI.

The MESH maturity scale Level Basic Description Ad hoc, informal practices. No formal risk processes or ownership structures. Ad Hoc Some processes in place, but inconsistent. Limited integration or documentation. Established Formal processes, periodic reviews, moderate awareness and response readiness. Advanced Cross-functional coordination, regular testing, embedded into operations. Leading Fully integrated strategy, continuous improvement, recognized as a competitive advantage. Average Maturity Distribution by Dimension (% of respondents per level) Dimension Basic Ad Hoc Established Advanced Leading Governance and strategic alignment Supply chain visibility and mapping Risk management and business continuity Supplier assurance and performance Logistics and transportation resilience Digital infrastructure and data integration Regulatory compliance and ethical standards Workforce capability and culture 11% 19% 14% 17% 13% 22% 10% 18% 28% 34% 31% 38% 35% 29% 25% 33% 39% 29% 33% 28% 33% 28% 36% 29% 18% 15% 18% 14% 16% 16% 24% 16% 4% 3% 4% 3% 3% 5% 5% 4% MESH Supply Chain Resilience Report 2025 ©2025 BSI.

Key insights The most common maturity level across all dimensions is Ad Hoc (30–38%), indicating that many organizations have partial programs without consistent execution. Digital Infrastructure has the highest percentage of respondents in the Basic tier, revealing a widespread disconnect between tech adoption and resilience integration. Very few organizations reach the Leading tier across any dimension—suggesting a significant opportunity for competitive differentiation through resilience leadership. This maturity benchmark is not a scorecard—it’s a springboard. It gives organizations a way to prioritize investments, measure improvement, and communicate progress to stakeholders. – “The assessment shows us what we’ve long suspected—most supply chain risk programs are only mature on paper.” – COO, Multinational Manufacturing Firm 1919

Why leading firms treat supply chain maturity as a long-term asset, not a short-term fix As risk exposure increases and reputational stakes rise, more companies are allocating budget to supply chain resilience. But spending alone doesn’t equal impact—what matters is where and how that investment is made. According to MESH assessment respondents, 81% of organizations plan to increase their supply chain risk and resilience investment over the next 12 months. However, only 32% have a cross-functional budget tied to supply chain resilience—suggesting that most funding still flows through siloed functions like procurement, compliance, or IT. Average % of operational or IT budget allocated to resilience-related initiatives: l s e e y o p m e f o . o N 1–50 51–250 251–999 1,000+ 7% 6% 5% 4% t n e p s t e g d u b f o % Note: Includes investments in business continuity planning, supplier audits, risk platforms, training, and sustainability assurance. Where are high-maturity firms spending? Organizations scoring Advanced or Leading in the MESH framework tend to allocate their resilience budgets differently. Compared to Basic and Ad Hoc firms, they: Spend 2–3x more on scenario testing and simulation tools Invest in integrated platforms that connect ESG, risk, and procurement data Fund cross-functional training and stakeholder engagement programs Direct budget toward early-stage supplier onboarding and assurance Prioritize governance structure reviews and board-level risk reporting 21

“The budget is there—but it’s spread across functions with no unifying strategy. The MESH model helps us make the case for a coordinated investment roadmap.” – Head of Sustainability & Risk, Global Retail Brand Top justifications for increased investment (from MESH respondents): Increased frequency of supply chain disruptions Reputational risk linked to supplier performance Regulatory pressure and compliance complexity Need for real-time supply chain data and traceability Internal mandate for ESG and ethical sourcing transparency 63% 52% 48% 44% 39% Reason % of adoption rate Companies with higher maturity don’t just spend more—they spend smarter. They view resilience not as insurance against disruption, but as an enabler of continuity, trust, and long-term advantage. MESH Supply Chain Resilience Report 2025 ©2025 BSI. All rights reserved. 22

From insight to action – how organizations operationalize resilience A maturity assessment alone won’t make a supply chain resilient. The real transformation begins when organizations take those insights and convert them into sustained action—embedding risk thinking into day-to-day operations, decision-making, and culture. The role of BSI Connect in enabling maturity From one-off project to enterprise mindset BSI Connect provides the digital infrastructure to One of the most common patterns among Established move organizations from maturity insight to ongoing and Advanced organizations is a shift in language and improvement. Through features like: behavior: That’s where the MESH program stands apart. It’s not just a diagnostic—it’s a roadmap. • Checklists and Guidance Libraries tailored • Risk becomes a shared vocabulary across supply to MESH dimensions chain, finance, IT, legal, and sustainability teams Organizations that achieve measurable gains in their MESH scores do three things differently: • • Supplier and site-level assurance tools Digital self-assessments and benchmarking dashboards • Leadership mandates support not just compliance, but continuous improvement • Progress is monitored not just via lagging KPIs, but also leading indicators of risk readiness 1 2 3 They connect their maturity gaps to specific improvement plans. • Collaboration spaces for internal and external partners They use platforms like BSI Connect to operationalize change. • Automated reporting to align with ESG, ISO, and regulatory frameworks They treat resilience as a cross-functional capability—not just a supply chain issue. … organizations gain the structure, visibility, and repeatability they need to shift from ad hoc improvement to embedded resilience. “We used the MESH assessment to get a baseline—but Connect gave us the mechanism to actually build capability. It's now part of how we run our business.” — Global Supply Chain Director, Automotive Tier 1 Supplier 24
