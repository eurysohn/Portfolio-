A. GENERAL DEFINITIONS 1. Multinational enterprises Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are incorporated or unincorporated enterprises comprising parent enterprises and their foreign affiliates. A parent enterprise is defined as an enterprise that controls assets of other entities in countries other than its home country, usually by owning a certain equity capital stake. An equity capital stake of 10 per cent or more of the ordinary shares or voting power for an incorporated enterprise, or its equivalent for an unincorporated enterprise, is normally considered as the threshold for the control of asset.1 A foreign affiliate is an incorporated or unincorporated enterprise in which an investor, who is a resident in another economy, owns a stake that permits a lasting interest in the management of that enterprise (an equity stake of 10 per cent for an incorporated enterprise, or its equivalent for an unincorporated enterprise). In WIR, subsidiary enterprises, associate enterprises and branches – defined below – are all referred to as foreign affiliates or affiliates. • A subsidiary is an incorporated enterprise in the host country in which another entity directly owns more than a half of the shareholder's voting power, and has the right to appoint or remove a majority of the members of the administrative, management or supervisory body. • An associate is an incorporated enterprise in the host country in which an investor owns a total of at least 10 per cent, but not more than half, of the shareholders’ voting power. • A branch is a wholly or jointly owned unincorporated enterprise in the host country which is one of the following: (i) a permanent establishment or office of the foreign investor; (ii) an unincorporated partnership or joint venture between the foreign direct investor and one or more third parties; (iii) land, structures (except structures owned by government entities), and /or immovable equipment and objects directly owned by a foreign resident; or (iv) mobile equipment (such as ships, aircraft, gas or oil drilling rigs) operating within a country, other than that of the foreign investor, for at least one year. 2. Foreign direct investment Foreign direct investment (FDI) is defined as an investment involving a long term relationship and reflecting a lasting interest and control by a resident entity in one economy (foreign direct investor or parent enterprise) in an enterprise resident in an economy other than that of the foreign direct investor (FDI enterprise or affiliate enterprise or foreign affiliate).2 FDI implies that the investor exerts a significant degree of influence on the management of the enterprise resident in the other economy. Such investment involves both the initial transaction between the two entities and all subsequent transactions between them and among foreign affiliates, both incorporated and unincorporated. FDI may be undertaken by individuals as well as business entities. Flows of FDI comprise capital provided (either directly or through other related enterprises) by a foreign direct investor to an FDI enterprise, or capital received from an FDI enterprise by a foreign direct investor. FDI has three components: equity capital, reinvested earnings and intracompany loans. 3

• Equity capital is the foreign direct investor’s purchase of shares of an enterprise in a country other than its own. • Reinvested earnings comprise the direct investor’s share (in proportion to direct equity participation) of earnings not distributed as dividends by affiliates, or earnings not remitted to the direct investor. Such retained profits by affiliates are deemed reinvested. • Intracompany loans or intracompany debt transactions refer to short or long term borrowing and lending of funds between direct investors (parent enterprises) and affiliate enterprises. FDI stock is the value of the share of their capital and reserves (including retained profits) attributable to the parent enterprise, plus the net indebtedness of affiliates to the parent enterprise. 3. Non equity forms of investment Foreign direct investors may also obtain an effective voice in the management of another business entity through means other than acquiring an equity stake. These are non equity forms of investment, and they include, inter alia, subcontracting, management contracts, turnkey arrangements, franchising, licensing and product-sharing. Data on these forms of multinational corporate activity are usually not separately identified in the balance- of-payments statistics. These statistics, however, usually present data on royalties and licensing fees, defined as “receipts and payments of residents and non-residents for: (i) the authorized use of intangible non produced, non financial assets and proprietary rights such as trademarks, copyrights, patents, processes, techniques, designs, manufacturing rights, franchises, etc., and (ii) the use, through licensing agreements, of produced originals or prototypes, such as manuscripts, films, etc.”3 4. Methodological changes on FDI in BPM6 and BD4 In 2014, many countries adopted the new guidelines for the compilation of FDI data as part of balance of payments and international investment position statistics based on the sixth edition of IMF's Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) and the fourth edition of OECD's Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Investment (BD4). There are three major changes introduced in BPM6 and BD4 that have the most significant impact on the presentation and interpretation of FDI statistics. 1. Presentation of FDI statistics on an asset/liability basis instead of the directional principle that had been recommended by the previous editions of these international guidelines. On an asset/liability basis, direct investment statistics are organized according to whether the investment relates to an asset or a liability for the reporting country (for example, a country's assets include not only equity investments by MNEs resident in that country in their foreign affiliates abroad, but also loans made by the resident affiliates to their foreign parents abroad). As a result the asset/liability presentation does not show the direction of influence while the directional presentation does. Under the directional principle, the direct investment flows and positions are organized according to the direction of the investment for the reporting economy − either inward or outward (i.e. all flows and positions of MNEs in an economy are shown under outward investment and all flows and positions for foreign affiliates resident in that economy are shown under inward investment). 4

The two presentations differ in their treatment of reverse investment (reverse investment is when an affiliate provides loans or acquires less than 10 per cent equity in its parents). Under the directional presentation, reverse investment is subtracted to derive the total outward or inward investment of the reporting economy. Therefore, FDI statistics on an asset/liability basis tends to be higher than those under the directional principle, but such is not always the case. While the presentation on an asset/liability basis is appropriate for macroeconomic analysis (i.e. the impact on the balance of payments), the directional principle is more appropriate for analyzing FDI in the context of parent-affiliate relationship. These data will better assist policymakers and government officials to formulate investment policies. This is because this presentation captures the direction and degree of influence, and is useful for identifying the source or destination countries of direct investment in a particular reporting country or for assessing the access to specific markets by direct investors in that country. The absence of information on FDI on the directional basis may even hamper policymakers from making appropriate decisions and formulating investment policies for development. 2. Separately compiling FDI statistics for resident special purpose entities (SPE).4 BD4 recommends that countries compile their FDI statistics including and excluding resident SPEs. This recommendation provides a more meaningful measure of FDI of an economy by removing FDI that involves funds passing through an SPE on their way to other destinations (outward FDI) and those coming to the country through other economy’s SPE (inward FDI). 3. Flows and positions between fellow enterprises.5 Transactions and positions between fellow enterprises are part of FDI statistics as they are likely to be influenced by their common direct investors. BD4 recommends that recording flows and positions in a reporting country depends on the residency of the ultimate controlling parent.6 Flows and positions between fellow enterprises. FDI data in this report are based on the directional principle, unless otherwise indicated. 5

B. AVAILABILITY, LIMITATIONS AND ESTIMATES OF FDI DATA PRESENTED IN WIR 1. FDI flows FDI are on a net basis (capital transactions’ credits less debits between direct investors and their foreign affiliates), or net acquisitions of assets (outward FDI) and net incurrence of liabilities (inward FDI). Thus, negative net acquisitions of assets in the case of outward FDI or negative net incurrence in liabilities in the case of inward FDI are recorded as negative FDI; in such cases, at least one of the three components of FDI (equity capital, reinvested earnings or intracompany loans) is negative and is not offset by positive amounts of the other components. These are instances of reverse investment or disinvestment. UNCTAD regularly collects published and unpublished national official FDI data flows directly from central banks, statistical offices or national authorities on an aggregated and disaggregated basis for its FDI/MNE database (www.unctad.org/fdistatistics). These data constitute the main source (more than 90 per cent) for the reported data on FDI. These data are complemented by data obtained from other international organizations with partial data availability (or data based on asset/liability principle) such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as well as regional organizations such as the ASEAN Secretariat, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Banque Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest, Banque des Etats de l'Afrique Centrale and Eastern Caribbean Central Bank. If the data were not available from any of these sources, data from the Country Reports, under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreements, were also used. Finally, in those economies for which data were not available from any of the above- mentioned sources, or only partial data (quarterly or monthly) were available, estimates were made by: a. annualizing the data, where they are only partially available (monthly or quarterly) from either the national official source or the IMF; b. using mirror data on FDI outflows from and inflows to major economies in UNCTAD's FDI/MNE database as proxy. Longer time-series data are available on the WIR home page, www.unctad.org/wir or the FDI statistics home page, www.unctad.org/fdistatistics. 6

2. FDI stock Data on FDI stock are presented at market value, where available. If not available, data are presented at book value or historical cost, reflecting prices at the time when the investment was made. As in the case of flow data, UNCTAD regularly collects published and unpublished national official FDI stock data directly from central banks, statistical offices or national authorities on an aggregated and disaggregated basis for its FDI/MNE database (www.unctad.org/ fdistatistics). These data constitute the main source (more than 90 per cent) for the reported data on FDI. These data are complemented by data obtained from other international organizations with partial data availability (or data based on the asset/liability principle). For those economies for which data were not available from any of the above-mentioned sources, estimates were made by either adding up FDI flows over a period of time, or adding or subtracting flows to an FDI stock obtained for a particular year from official national sources, or the IMF data series on assets and liabilities of direct investment. Longer time-series data are available on the WIR home page, www.unctad.org/wir or the FDI statistics home page, www.unctad.org/fdistatistics. 7

D. DATA REVISIONS AND UPDATES All FDI data and estimates in WIR are continuously revised. Because of ongoing revisions, FDI data reported in WIR20 may differ from those reported in earlier Reports or other publications of UNCTAD or any other international or regional organizations. In particular, recent FDI data are being revised in many economies according to the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments International Position Manual of the IMF. Because of this, the data reported in last year’s Report may be completely or partly changed in this Report. 80

E. DATA VERIFICATION In compiling data for this year’s Report, published data and websites of national sources were consulted first. Requests were then made to national official sources of all economies for verification and/or updates and supplementary data. The verification process continued until 21 May 2020. Any revisions made after this process may not be reflected in the Report. Below is a list of economies for which data were confirmed through this process. For the economies not mentioned below, the UNCTAD secretariat could not verify the data with respective governments.

F. DEFINITIONS AND SOURCES OF OTHER DATA 1. Cross-border M&As FDI is a balance-of-payments concept involving the cross-border transfer of funds. Cross- border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) statistics shown in the Report are based on information reported by Refinitiv. Such M&As conform to the FDI definition as far as the equity share is concerned. However, the data also include purchases via domestic and international capital markets, which cannot always be considered FDI flows. Although it is possible to distinguish types of financing used for M&As (e.g. syndicated loans, corporate bonds, venture capital), it is not possible to trace the origin or country-sources of the funds used. Therefore, the data used in the Report include the funds not categorized as FDI. The UNCTAD database on cross-border M&As contains information on ultimate and immediate target and acquiring countries. To approximate FDI flows as close as possible, tables relating to cross-border M&As by region/country are tabulated based on: 1) the immediate target country principle for the sales of equity shares in a resident enterprise; 2) the ultimate acquiring country principle for the purchases of equity shares in a non-resident enterprise; and 3) the ultimate target country principle for the sales of equity shares in a non- resident enterprise, unless otherwise specified. Round tripping cases are also considered on the basis of the immediate acquiring and immediate target country principles. FDI flows are recorded on a net basis (capital account credits less debits between direct investors and their foreign affiliates) in a particular year. M&A data are also recorded on a net basis, i.e. expressed as differences between gross cross-border acquisitions and divestment by firms in/from a particular country or in/from a particular industry. Transaction amounts recorded in the UNCTAD M&A statistics are those at the time of closure of the deals, and not at the time of announcement. The M&A values are not necessarily paid out in a single year. There are three main types of cross-border M&A deals: 1) those that involve the sale of a domestic company to a foreign company; 2) those that involve the sale of a foreign affiliate to a domestic company; and 3) those that involve the purchase by a foreign company of another foreign company operating in a host country. Three examples are given to illustrate differences in the three main types of deal, and the way they are recorded: 1. A domestic company in country A is sold to a foreign company. Country A is the immediate target country, and the foreign country is the ultimate acquiring country. The deal is recorded as the creation of a foreign investment in country A (inward investment / positive sale) and the creation of an investment abroad in the foreign country (outward investment / positive purchase). 2. A domestic company of country A acquires the affiliate of a foreign company operating in country A. Country A is the immediate target country, and the foreign country is the ultimate target country. The deal is recorded as the dissolution of a foreign investment (inward divestment / negative sale) in country A and the dissolution of an investment abroad (outward divestment / negative purchase) in the foreign country. 82

3. A foreign company X acquires an affiliate of foreign company Y operating in country A. Country A is the immediate target country, foreign country Y is the ultimate target country, and foreign country X is the ultimate acquiring country. The deal is recorded as an inward investment (positive sale) by foreign country X in country A and an inward investment (negative sale) by foreign country Y in country A, with the net-change being zero in country A. It is also recorded as an outward investment (positive purchase) in foreign country X, and as an outward divestment (negative purchase) in foreign country Y. Data showing cross-border M&A activities by industry are also recorded on a net basis as sales and purchases. The UNCTAD database contains information on the industries of both the immediate and ultimate host and home economies. Tables relating to cross- border M&As by sector/industry are tabulated based on the industry of the immediate host economy for sales and the industry of the ultimate home economy for purchases. Following are three illustrative examples: 1. A foreign food MNE acquires, in a given country, a domestic chemical company. This transaction is recorded in the columns on M&As by industry of seller in the chemical industry with positive sign. It is also recorded in the columns on M&As by industry of purchaser in the food industry (with positive sign). 2. A domestic food company acquires, in its own country, the affiliate of a foreign-owned company operating in the chemical industry. This transaction is recorded in the columns on M&As by industry of seller in the chemical industry with a negative sign. It is also recorded in the columns on M&As by industry of purchaser in the chemical industry with a negative sign. (As this database has no information about the industry of the parent company that is divesting its chemical foreign affiliate, the same industry as that of its foreign affiliate is used). 3. A foreign food MNE acquires, in a given country, an affiliate operating in the chemical industry owned by another foreign MNE. This transaction is recorded in the columns on M&As by industry of seller in the chemical industry with both negative and positive signs, with the net-change being zero. It is also recorded in the columns on M&As by industry of purchaser in the food industry (with positive sign) and the chemical industry (with negative sign).

FDI Markets tracks all new investment projects and expansion of existing investments without information on the equity participation by investors. It suggests that data may include investments that are not qualified as FDI. Joint- ventures are also included only where they lead to a new physical operation. While there is no minimum size for a project to be included, as a selection criteria for inclusion in this database, an investment project has to create new direct jobs and capital investment. Information sources to collate and validate those projects include Financial Times newswires, nearly 9,000 media sources, project data received from over 1,000 industry organizations and investment agencies, data purchased from market research and publication companies. The data are cross-referenced against multiple sources and over 90 per cent of them are validated with company sources. As far as the industry classification is concerned, every FDI project tracked by FDI Markets is classified according to its cluster, sector, and business activity, based on a proprietary industry classification system. Longer time-series data are available on the WIR home page, www.unctad.org/wir or the FDI statistics home page, www.unctad.org/fdistatistics. NOTES 1 2 3 4 5 6 In some countries, an equity stake of other than 10 per cent is still used. In the United Kingdom, for example, a stake of 20 per cent or more was the threshold used until 1997. This general definition of FDI is based on OECD, Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Investment, third edition (OECD 1996) and International Monetary Fund, Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (IMF 1993) and Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition (IMF 2009). International Monetary Fund, Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition, p. 40. In the sixth edition, it refers to "charges for the use of intellectual property". SPE are legal entities that have little or no employment, or operations, or physical presence in the jurisdiction in which they are created by their parent enterprises which are typically located in other jurisdictions (economies). They are often used as vehicles to raise capital or to hold assets and liabilities and usually do not undertake significant production (BD4). Fellow enterprises are enterprises, in the same or in different economies, related through the FDI relationship without either being a direct investor in the other, but through being directly or indirectly influenced by the same enterprise in the ownership hierarchy (BD4). The ultimate controlling parent is the entity at the top of the ownership chain that is not controlled by any other entity. 84
