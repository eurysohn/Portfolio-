What is the Logistics Performance Index? Based on a worldwide survey of global freight forwarders and express carriers, the Logistics Performance Index is a benchmarking tool developed by the World Bank that measures performance along the logistics supply chain within a country. Allowing for comparisons across 167 countries, the index can help countries identif y challenges and opportunities and improve their logistics performance. The World Bank conducts the survey every two years. Reliable logistics is indispensable to integrate global value chains—and reap the beneﬁt of trade opportunities for growth and poverty reduction. The ability to connect to the global logistics web depends on a country’s infrastructure, service markets, and trade processes. Government and the private sector in many developing countries should improve these areas—or face the large and growing costs of exclusion. This is the sixth edition of Connecting to Compete, a report summarizing the ﬁndings from the new dataset for the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) and its component indicators. The 2018 LPI also provides expanded data on supply chain performance and constraints in more than 100 countries, including information on time, distance and reliability, and ratings on domestic infrastructure quality, services, and border agencies. The 2018 LPI encapsulates the ﬁrsthand knowledge of movers of international trade. This information is relevant for policymakers and the private sector seeking to identify reform priorities for “soft” and “hard” trade and logistics infrastructure. Findings include: • Gaps in logistics performance between the bottom and top performers persist. • • • Supply chain reliability and service quality are strongly associated with logistics performance. Infrastructure and trade facilitation initiatives still play an important role in assuring basic connectivity and access to gateways for most developing countries. The logistics policy agenda continues to broaden, with growing focus on supply chain resilience, cyber security, environmental sustainability, and skills shortages.

Foreword Caroline Freund, Director, Macroeconomics, Trade and Investment Global Practice, The World Bank Group José Luis Irigoyen, Senior Director, Transport and Digital Development Global Practice, The World Bank Group We are happy to present the sixth edition of Connecting to Compete and the 2018 edition of the Logistics Performance Index (LPI). This interdisciplinary World Bank project was launched just over 10 years ago. The ambition was to develop simple comparators of how effi- ciently supply chains connect firms to markets, or logistics performance. Since 2007, most of the countries the World Bank Group works with are well aware of the importance of logistics performance for growth and integration. The cross- cutting na- ture of logistics as a policy area is widely rec- ognized: logistics is not just about connecting infrastructure but encompasses regulation of services, sustainability, and resilience, or trade facilitation. We see that this regular publication has had a significant impact in helping countries frame their own policies and motivate consistent ap- proaches to interventions and reforms at the national level. In some cases, the World Bank has been asked to provide support, which we did by bringing expertise and tools that address the country-specific supply chain constraints more deeply than the rough indications from the LPI can. The LPI remains unique in providing a common referential across countries. The exercise may seem a bit repetitive. The list of best performers does not change very much over the course of two years. We invite the reader to look beyond country rankings and look at the nexus of themes and policies. The lo- gistics sector is changing fast, in terms of the nature of demand (for example, e-commerce), players, use of technology, new risks (cyberse- curity), and policy concerns. Professionals and countries are increasingly concerned with the environmental footprint and resilience of sup- ply chains. We hope this work will appeal to a broad and diverse audience: policy makers, practitio- ners, and researchers. We are confident readers will find this report and its data useful.

Foreword Young Tae Kim, Secretary-General, International Transport Forum at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Logistics is an elevated priority for many mem- ber countries of the International Transport Forum. Because facilitating trade and trans- port is at the core of stimulating economic development, several countries have developed comprehensive national logistics strategies. Well- functioning domestic and international logistics is a precondition of national competi- tiveness. And fact-based metrics can provide reliable benchmarks, assess policy impacts, and compare global advances in logistics. The World Bank Logistics Performance Index (LPI) is a unique benchmarking tool, providing the same measure for more than 160 countries. At the International Transport Forum, we use the LPI as the most important starting point of dialogue with our member countries on the drivers of logistics performance. The six components of the LPI — customs, infra- structure, ease of arranging shipments, quality of logistics services, timeliness, and tracking and tracing — point to policy actions that can sup- port the improvement of each individual ele- ment. International Transport Forum studies have examined the drivers of logistics perfor- mance and assessed the development of national logistics observatories in Chile, Mexico, Turkey, and more recently Vietnam. The LPI is a crucial part of global efforts to better understand logistics performance in the context of increasingly complex supply chains. I am sure the 2018 edition of the LPI will be used extensively by governments, international organizations, private firms, and academia in ef- forts to improve logistics — the backbone of the global economy.

As in previous years, a team at Communications Development — led by Bruce Ross-Larson — designed, edited, and typeset the report. The Logistics Performance Index (LPI) sur- vey would not have been possible without the support and participation of the International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations (www.fiata.com), especially of Marco Sorgetti, FIATA’s former Director General, as well as Hans Günther Kersten, FIATA’s current Direc- tor General. National freight forwarding asso- ciations and a large group of small, medium, and large logistics companies worldwide were instru- mental in disseminating the survey. The survey was designed with Finland’s Turku School of Economics, University of Turku (www.utu.fi/ en), which has worked with the World Bank to develop the concept since 2007. The authors are also grateful to external colleagues for their support and contributions in reaching out to forwarding associations and providing inputs for the report, including Ruth Banomyong (Thammasat University, Thai- land), Tapio Naula (Oman Logistics Center), and Cesar Lavalle (ILOS Brazil). Daniel Cra- mer of BlueTundra.com designed, developed, and maintained the LPI survey and result websites under the guidance of the core team. Scott Johnson from the World Bank Informa- tion Solutions Group helped the team distribute the survey. The authors thank the hundreds of employ- ees of freight forwarding and express carrier companies around the world who responded to the survey. Their participation was central to the quality and credibility of the project, and their continuing feedback will be essential as we de- velop and refine the survey and the LPI in years to come.

Summary and key findings This sixth edition of Connecting to Compete, the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) report, presents the latest worldwide view on trade logistics performance across more than 160 countries as seen by logistics professionals. This biennial information on logistics infrastructure, service provision, cross-border trade facilitation, and other aspects is invaluable for policy makers, traders, and a wide audience of other stakeholders, including researchers and teachers. The LPI survey data provide numerical evidence on how easy or difficult it is in these countries to transport general merchandise — typically manufactured products in unitized form. The six main indicators of the interna- tional part of the LPI summarize on a five-point scale the assessments of logistics professionals worldwide trading with the country. The domestic part of the LPI indicates the quality and availability of key logistics services within a country, but due to the small number of responses, these data are more informative in comparisons by region or income group. Logistics is understood as a network of services that support the physical movement of goods, trade across borders, and commerce within borders. It comprises an array of activities beyond transportation, including warehousing, brokerage, express delivery, terminal operations, and related data and information management. The global turnover generated by these net- works exceeds US$4.3 trillion, so a better under- standing of their operation is no trivial issue.1 For individual countries, logistics performance is key to economic growth and competitiveness. Inefficient logistics raises the cost of doing busi- ness and reduces the potential for both interna- tional and domestic integration. The toll can be particularly heavy for developing countries try- ing to compete in the global marketplace. Logistics performance matters Not surprisingly, an effective logistics sector is now recognized almost everywhere as one of the core enablers of development. Previous editions of Connecting to Compete have high- lighted how implementing better policies leads to better logistics performance. Such policies cover, for example, regulating services; provid- ing transportation infrastructure; implement- ing controls, especially for international goods; and raising the quality of public–private part- nerships (PPPs). The policy focus has evolved since 2007, when the first LPI report was published. Ini- tially, logistics policies tended to concentrate on facilitating trade and removing border bot- tlenecks. Today, international logistics is in- creasingly intertwined with domestic logistics. Policy makers and stakeholders deal with a wide range of policies. Growing concerns include spatial planning; skills and resources for train- ing; the environmental, social, and economic sustainability of the supply chain; and the resil- ience of the supply chain to disruption or disas- ter (physical or digital). Gaps in logistics performance persist Overall, the score profile of the entire set of more than 160 countries has remained simi- lar since the 2007 edition, an indication of the robust nature of underlying data.2 The modest convergence of scores from 2007 to 2014 was explained in the 2014 edition by a perceived improvement in the trade-supporting infra- structure of low- and middle-income countries and, to less extent, in their logistics services and customs and border management.

Countries that have traditionally dominated the supply chain industry occupy the top 10 rankings: eight in Europe plus Japan and Singapore explanation appeared largely valid for most countries being ranked. In 2016, however, the gap seemed to widen between the top and the bottom, with the highest average scores ever for the top 10 countries (4.13 on a scale from 1 to 5) and the lowest scores since 2007 for countries at the bottom (1.91; table S.1). In 2018, the gap between top and bot- tom performers narrowed again. The average score for the top 10 countries dropped to 4.03, whereas the bottom 10 countries scored an all- time high of 2.08 (figure S.1). High-income countries occupied the top 10 rankings in 2018,3 eight in Europe plus Japan and Singapore — countries that have tradition- ally dominated the supply chain industry. Ger- many is at the top, scoring 4.20. The scores of the following nine countries are in a tight inter- val, with Sweden in 2nd with a score of 4.05 and Finland in 10th with a score of 3.97. The bottom 10 countries are mostly low- income and lower-middle-income countries in Africa or isolated areas. Some are fragile econo- mies affected by armed conflict, natural disas- ters, and political unrest. Others are landlocked countries naturally challenged by geography or economies of scale in connecting to global sup- ply chains. Afghanistan ranks 160th with a score 1.95, preceded by Angola (2.05), Burundi (2.06), and Niger (2.07). Among the lower-middle-income countries, large economies such as India (44th with a score of 3.18) and Indonesia (46th with a score of 3.15) and emerging economies such as Vietnam (39th with a score of 3.27) and Côte d’Ivoire (50th with a score of 3.08) stand out as top per- formers. Most of these countries either have ac- cess to sea or are located close to major trans- portation hubs. The composition of the top-performing upper-middle-income economies has changed Figure S.1 LPI score as a percentage of the highest score by quintile average, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 Percent 2012 2014 2016 2018 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 Bottom quintile Fourth quintile Third quintile Second quintile Top quintile Source: Logistics Performance Index 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018. marginally, with China (26th with a score of 3.61), Thailand (32nd with a score of 3.41), and South Africa (33rd with a score of 3.38) leading the group. Romania, Croatia, and Bulgaria also improved their rankings. Among low-income countries, those in East and West Africa lead in this year’s edition. Supply chain reliability and service quality are strongly associated with logistics performance Supply chain reliability is key to logistics per- formance. In a global environment, consignees require a high degree of certainty as to when and how deliveries will take place. Reliability is typically much more important than speed, and many shippers are willing to pay a premium. In other words, supply chain predictability is a matter not just of time and cost, but also a com- ponent of shipment quality (figure S.2).

For the first time, the perceived improvement in infrastructure quality is higher in the bottom quintile than in the top Figure S.2 Respondents reporting that shipments are “often” or “nearly always” cleared and delivered as scheduled, by LPI quintile Percent of respondents Imports Exports 100 75 50 25 0 Bottom quintile (lowest performance) Fourth quintile (low performance) Third quintile (average performance) Second quintile (high performance) Top quintile (highest performance) Source: Logistics Performance Index 2018. In the top LPI quintile, just 13 percent of shipments fail to meet company quality criteria — the same proportion as in 2014 and 2016. By comparison, two to three times as many ship- ments in the two bottom quintiles fail to meet these criteria, and quality criteria in low-per- forming countries tend to be less rigid than in high-performing ones. This finding illustrates the persistence of the logistics gap from an over- all perspective of supply chain efficiency and reliability. The differing pace of progress is also seen in the ratings of domestic trade and transport infrastructure, where respondents were asked to assess how much these have improved since 2015. As in previous surveys, satisfaction with infrastructure quality varies by infrastructure type. For the first time, however, the perceived improvement is higher in the bottom quintile than in the top, although the difference is weaker in the middle of the distribution. Respondents in all LPI quintiles are highly satisfied with information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure. The infra- structure gap continues to narrow, particularly between the top and the bottom, where the rate of improvement seems noticeably faster. Im- provement in the middle quintiles is on a par with what has been observed previously. In contrast to ICT, rail infrastructure continues to elicit general dissatisfaction. Similar patterns emerge when the domestic LPI data on infrastructure are disaggregated by World Bank region, excluding high-income countries. ICT is rated at the top or very close to the top in all regions. Delivering good quality services is key to successful operations, and its importance is growing The LPI has shown that service quality drives logistics performance in practically all econo- mies. Yet developing advanced services, such as third-party or fourth-party logistics, requires following a complex policy agenda, partly because such services cannot be created from scratch or developed purely domestically. In logistics-friendly countries, manufacturers and traders already outsource much of their basic logistics operations to third-party providers and focus on pursuing their core business while managing more complex supply chains issues. This handoff is reciprocal: the more that such advanced services are available at a reasonable cost, the more shippers will outsource their logistics. But the less that reliable and compre- hensive services are available, the more shippers will handle logistics in house.

The 2018 LPI survey confirms that demand for sustainable supply chain management goes hand in hand with logistics performance Logistics services are provided under very different operational environments globally. In a pattern recurring across years, the quality of the services that logistics firms provide is often perceived as better than the quality of the corre- sponding infrastructure that they operate. This may be explained partly by who the respondents are — freight forwarders and logistics firms rat- ing their own services. In a pattern seen across LPI editions, op- erations that support international trade, such as air and maritime transport and supporting services, tend to receive high scores even when infrastructure bottlenecks exist. Railroads, on the other hand, have low ratings almost every- where. Low-income countries score poorly on road freight and warehousing. Service quality can differ substantially at similar levels of perceived infrastructure qual- ity. Even high-quality “hard” infrastructure cannot substitute for operational excellence, based on “soft” infrastructure such as profes- sional skills and smooth business and adminis- trative processes. Supply chain resilience and sustainability are emerging concerns The resilience of international and domestic supply chains has emerged as a growing policy concern worldwide. Resilience is understood as the ability of an organization (or a country) to recover from severe disruptions, whether human caused or natural. For 2018, the LPI survey included a question on cybersecurity resilience. The perceived magnitude of cyber- threats and preparedness to mitigate their effects go hand in hand (figure S.3). Devel- oping countries lag far behind high-income countries in both. The 2018 LPI survey confirms that demand for sustainable supply chain management goes hand in hand with logistics performance. This is especially true for environmentally sustainable services (green logistics). In the top quintile of LPI performers, 28 percent of respondents in- dicated that shippers often or nearly always ask for environmentally friendly options. In the second-highest quintile, the share drops to 14 percent, and it falls steadily in the third (9 percent), fourth (7 percent) and fifth (5 per- cent) quintiles. This trend is in line with the increasing number of global and national commitments to reduce freight- and logistics-related greenhouse gases, particulate matter, and other harmful emissions. Regulatory changes have been imple- mented in all transport modes, and the interna- tional targets for 2030 and 2050, for example, are ever more challenging.

Countries that introduce far-reaching changes appear to be those that treat logistics as integral to the economy Pushing the envelope of implementation Implementation of effective policies to improve logistics performance is at least as challenging today as in 2007 — for two reasons. First, the scope of implementation has widened from the traditional focus on infrastructure and trade facilitation. Sustainability and resilience receive more attention, and not only by devel- oped countries, as do skills development and training, spatial dimensions of logistics, and the specificity of the regulatory and legal frame- work. In addition to these emerging fields, reg- ulatory reforms of the logistics services sectors are critical but remain challenging to imple- ment in many developing countries. Regula- tory improvements aim to improve the quality of service delivery, building on market mecha- nisms and private sector participation, in the sectors that constitute the core of logistics activ- ities, such as trucking, brokerage, and terminal or warehousing operations. The broad and cross- cutting logistics agenda challenge policy mak- ers to make sense of which policy measures are needed, when, and using what resources. Second, most reforms involve more than one agency and many stakeholders, slowing implementation, or even reversing it if coopera- tive mechanisms are not sustainable. This prob- lem is well-known in developing countries for transport (for example, transport corridors) and trade facilitation (for example, single-window trade facilitation). For consistent and broad reforms and im- provements, countries must deal with this com- plexity. But countries in the middle and lower tiers of performance are deterred by weaker co- ordination mechanisms and private sector con- stituencies than countries with modern and in- novative logistics sectors. Even though logistics services are provided overwhelmingly by the pri- vate sector, public sector actors and institutions play an essential role, without which logistics competitiveness is unlikely to improve. Administrative reforms can be rapid when countries with a strong political will align their efforts. In some cases, soft reforms in facilita- tion of trade and transport were implemented with considerable impact even before hard infrastructure projects were completed. The soft reforms provided a higher and quicker re- turn on investment than hard infrastructure. Examples can be found in low- and middle- income countries such as India, Lao PDR, Southern African countries, and Vietnam and in high-income countries such as Oman. Un- fortunately, performance may be degraded by governance weaknesses and economic and so- cial turmoil, as for some Arab countries in the 2016 and 2018 LPI reports. Low-performing countries with serious governance challenges (conflict-ridden or postconflict countries and fragile states) are the most in need of attention from their neighbors and the international community. Ultimately, countries that introduce far- reaching changes appear to be those that treat logistics as integral to the economy. They tend to combine policy perspectives, such as regula- tory reform, trade facilitation, and trade and investment planning. Seamless interagency co- ordination and, above all, strong public–private dialogue characterize the top performers. They offer very positive examples of coordinating and facilitating logistics bodies, some of them pub- lic–private institutions such as the most famous one, the Dutch Dinalog. Influence of the Logistics Performance Index Since its inception in 2007, the Connecting to Compete report providing LPI ratings has moved trade logistics firmly onto the policy agenda, even for countries that had not previ- ously considered them. LPI results have also been used in many policy reports and docu- ments prepared by multilateral organizations or the consultants they have engaged. The findings provide a worldwide general benchmark for the logistics industry and for logistics users. LPI results have been embraced by the aca- demic community, as evidenced by the wide- spread use of LPI data in research reports, jour- nal articles, and textbooks. The results have also been used in teaching, and thousands of theses at all levels have cited the LPI.

Using LPI data requires caution, because they are based on a web-based survey aggre- gating the views of the worldwide logistics and freight-forwarding community. To avoid overly simplistic conclusions, section 1 of Connecting to Compete presents detailed instructions on how to use — and how not to use — LPI data for various purposes. * * * Logistics performance is based largely on reli- able supply chains and predictable service delivery for traders. Global supply chains are becoming more and more complex. Ever more demanding regulatory requirements for trad- ers and operators are motivated by safety, social, environmental, and other reasons. Efficient management and information technology solu- tions in both the private and public sectors are tools for high-quality logistics. National com- petitiveness depends on the ability to manage logistics in today’s global business environment. More than ever, comprehensive reforms and long-term commitments are needed from policy makers and private stakeholders. The current LPI data provide a unique and updated refer- ence for better understanding the impediments to trade logistics worldwide and for informing policy making and business decisions. 6 C O N N E C T I N G T O C O M P E T E 2 0 18 T R A D E L O G I S T I C S I N T H E G L O B A L E C O N O M Y

O I T C E S N1 The 2018 Logistics Performance Index This is the sixth edition of Connecting to Compete, the biennial Logistics Performance Index (LPI) report. Global logistics is often referred to as the “physical internet,” as it was in the initial 2007 LPI report. Logistics is a network of services that support the physical movement of goods, trade across borders, and commerce within borders. Logistics encompasses an array of activities beyond transportation, including warehousing, brokerage, express delivery, and critical infrastructure services such as terminals. Competing international networks of increasingly multi service logistics providers offer ever more diversified solutions for trade, commerce, and manufacturing. Indeed, the annual turnover generated by these global networks exceeds US$4.3 trillion.4 The role of logistics in the global economy is better recognized today than it was 10 years ago. Good logistics services reduce the cost of trade. Logistics performance is about how effi- ciently supply chains connect firms to domestic and international opportunities. The LPI tries to capture how logistically accessible, or how well connected to the physical internet of global logistics, a country is. It includes several dimen- sions that will be developed in this report. Logistics is business to business (B2B): its activities are executed primarily by private com- panies for private companies. For this reason, the LPI relies directly on the knowledge of lo- gistics professionals worldwide (box 1.1). But the performance of logistics in each economy depends on the public sector’s interventions and policies — that was the main message of the initial 2007 LPI report, and it remains true today. Public features include regulation; trans- portation infrastructure; the implementation of controls, especially for international goods (as in trade facilitation); and the quality of public–private partnership and dialogue. Previ- ous Connecting to Compete reports have empha- sized that better policies lead to better logistics performance. Since the LPI was launched, gaps in perfor- mance have persisted between low- performing countries and high-performing ones, mostly in Europe and East Asia, where logistics has de- veloped into an important service sector. The importance of logistics-related policies in en- hancing performance is more recognized today than in 2007, and the policy focus has evolved. Initially, logistics policies focused on trade fa- cilitation and removal of border bottlenecks. Today, such international logistics issues are difficult to separate from domestic ones. And policy makers and stakeholders deal with a wider range of policies, increasingly with safety and sustainability in mind. Emerging policy concerns include spatial planning, greening the supply chain, and bolstering the resilience of the supply chain to disruption or disasters (physical or digital) (see section 3). And skills and training resources have recently received more attention. The growing scope of logistics performance and increasing recognition of its contribution to growth and economic integration call for holis- tic policies. More and more countries, especially emerging economies, see logistics as a sector of the economy requiring consistent policy making that cuts across traditional logistics areas. Previ- ous LPI reports have referred to many countries having set up national strategies or dedicated or- ganizations advancing logistics, such as Canada, China, France, Indonesia, Morocco, the Neth- erlands, and Thailand. For the 2018 edition, the examples include Oman (see box 3.3 in section 3) and India, which in 2017 set up a dedicated logistics body under a Special Secretary.

Box 1.1 The six components of the international Logistics Performance Index The World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI) analyzes coun- are best positioned to assess how countries perform.

Input and outcome LPI indicators 4. The competence and quality of logistics services. 5. The ability to track and trace consignments. 6. The frequency with which shipments reach consignees within the scheduled or expected delivery time. The components were chosen based on theoretical and empiri- cal research and on the practical experience of logistics profession- als involved in international freight forwarding. The figure maps the six LPI indicators onto two main categories: • Areas for policy regulation, indicating main inputs to the sup- ply chain (customs, infrastructure, and services). • Supply chain performance outcomes (corresponding to LPI indicators of time, cost, and reliability — timeliness, interna- tional shipments, and tracking and tracing). The LPI uses standard statistical techniques to aggregate the data into a single indicator (see appendix 5 for a detailed description of how the LPI is calculated).a This single indicator can be used to compare countries, regions, and income groups. Customs Infra- structure Services quality Supply chain service delivery Timeliness Inter- national shipments Tracking and tracing Areas for policy regulations (inputs) Service delivery performance outcomes Time, cost, reliability Because operators on the ground can best assess the vital See the 2018 LPI questionnaire at www.worldbank.org/lpi. aspects of logistics performance, the LPI relies on an online survey of logistics professionals from the companies responsible for mov- a. In all six editions of the LPI (2007, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018), ing goods around the world: multinational freight forwarders and statistical aggregation has produced an overall index close to the simple the main express carriers. Freight forwarders and express carriers average of country scores across the six LPI components. Guidelines on how to use the LPI and how to interpret it Since 2007, LPI findings have become standard reference material in numerous studies and pol- icy papers on trade logistics. The LPI has been adopted by several countries as a key perfor- mance indicator in their national transport or logistics strategies. It is also used as a subset of transport or logistics key performance indica- tors by the European Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Asia-Pacific Eco- nomic Cooperation, and others. (See more in box 3.1 in section 3). This makes it important to highlight how best to use the LPI and its indicators to avoid possible misinterpretations (box 1.2). First, LPI data are gathered through a worldwide survey of logistics professionals on how easy or difficult they experience trade lo- gistics along six generic dimensions when deal- ing with eight preselected countries (see box 1.1 and the LPI methodology in appendix 5). As a survey, the LPI is subject to sampling error, di- verging opinions of the respondents, and varia- tion of the respondent base from one LPI report to the next. The number of evaluations received per country may also vary a lot. So, it is important to check the confidence interval (CI) of a country’s LPI scores before making any deeper judgment: the narrower the CI, the more reliable the score. Large traders, such as China, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, tend to have a CI at 0.05 score points or below, which is about 1 percent or less of their scores. By contrast, some smaller traders’ CIs are often closer to 0.5 score points, which may be more than 15 percent of their 8 C O N N E C T I N G T O C O M P E T E 2 0 18 T R A D E L O G I S T I C S I N T H E G L O B A L E C O N O M Y

Box 1.2 How precise are LPI scores and ranks? Although the LPI and its components now offer the most compre- confidence intervals to account for sampling error, a country’s exact hensive and comparable data on country logistics and trade facili- ranking might be less relevant to policy makers than its proxim- tation environments, they have a limited domain of validity because ity to others in a wider performance group or its statistically sig- of the limited experience of survey respondents and, for landlocked nificant improvement.

This means that countries at similar perfor- of its 2018 LPI score exceeds the upper bound of its 2016 score. mance levels may have substantially different ranks, especially in Because of the LPI’s limited domain of validity and the need for the middle range. scores. Changes can be statistically significant only if the CIs for the scores of two consecutive years do not overlap. Second, the overall LPI score is a more tell- ing indicator than the LPI rank, because scores are more accurate and provide a better basis for comparison over time. Especially for countries ranked in the middle range, scores may differ lit- tle even if rank positions can be quite far apart: for example, Egypt, ranked 60th, and Bangla- desh, ranked 100th, both fall within 0.36 score points, an interval where the average difference per country is only 0.0088 score points. Thus, the fluctuation in a country’s rank from one LPI report to the next may appear much larger than the actual change in its score. For this reason, the 2018 LPI uses the weighted average LPI score as the primary in- dicator, taking away much of the oscillation in scores from one LPI to another. The weighted average values of the four most recent LPI sur- veys were provided in appendix 4 in the 2014 and 2016 LPI reports, too. Using the aggregate values and following their development over time provides a more balanced picture of a coun- try’s logistics performance than relying solely on single-year data. For El Salvador, for instance, with aggregate values, the maximum interval of both score (0.18 score points) and rank changes (20 rank positions) are about half of what they are with single-year scores and ranks (0.38 score points and 37 rank positions) in the interval covering the LPI reports in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018. Third, the direction of trade in the interna- tional LPI is important to the countries being evaluated. In addition, the traded products cov- ered could be labeled “general merchandise,” so the responses provide less information on goods that require specific care, such as pharmaceuti- cals, food, and those labeled as dangerous. Fur- thermore, the respondents are freight forward- ers, express carriers, and logistics providers (by road, rail, shipping, and air transport). Consequently, manufactured products transported in unitized form make up the core of trade covered, where freight forwarders are typically used as intermediaries. Trade of large volumes of raw materials and energy products handled in bulk (such as ores, grain, oil, and gas) is not covered well in the LPI. Such large-volume trade uses either direct industry buyer–seller channels or another type of intermediaries, such as commodity traders or shipping brokers.

The LPI is best used as a snapshot of where a country stands on logistics, and it can serve as an entry point to a more comprehensive assessment of a country’s logistics performance Fourth, especially in poor countries, tradi- tional operators often play a larger role in trade arrangements than international freight for- warders. Traditional and international opera- tors may differ in their interactions with gov- ernment agencies, and in their service levels. In developing countries, international networks tend to serve large companies, which may have significantly different service level criteria for time, cost, and other aspects from traditional trading networks. Fifth, for most landlocked countries and small island states, the LPI might reflect access problems outside the country assessed, such as transit difficulties. The rating of a landlocked country might not adequately assess its trade facilitation reform efforts, because their success depends on international transit routes through its neighbors. In summary, individual country data— especially rank positions tracked from one LPI report to the next—should preferably not be used as the sole indicator, but should be considered in combination with scores, while also keeping the size of the CI in mind. Using the weighted aggregate score and rank data that rely on the four latest LPI ratings is also a good idea, as they provide a more balanced picture. Furthermore, very few improvements in a country’s operational or regulatory environment immediately affect the global freight forwarding and logistics professionals view on that country. However, some negative developments, such as a devastating natural catastrophe or an outbreak of a serious and wide-spread armed conflict may impact a country’s ratings more quickly than any positive changes. Put differently: positive changes tend to take more time, while some (extreme) negative ones might have a more sudden impact. The LPI has been effective at galvanizing interest in and making the case for reform in several countries. It is best used as a snapshot of where a country stands on logistics, and it can serve as an entry point to a more comprehensive assessment of a country’s logistics performance. This can entail, for instance, assessments of the different transport modes (road, rail, air, maritime, and inland shipping), internal logistics, dwell time studies, and an assessment of professional skills and training in the logistics sector. Features of the 2018 survey The 2018 LPI survey employed the same meth- odology as the previous five editions of Con- necting to Compete: a standardized ques- tionnaire with two parts, international and domestic. In the international questionnaire, respondents evaluate six indicators of logis- tics performance in up to eight of their main overseas partner countries (see box 1.1 for the six indicators). In the domestic questionnaire, respondents are asked to provide qualitative and quantitative data for the logistics environment in the country where they work. In 2018, almost 6,000 country assessments were made by logistics professionals. This edition covers 160 countries in the international LPI and 100 countries in the domestic LPI. The report provides new insights on cybersecurity threats in logistics and the use of electronic trading platforms by shippers. Given that the LPI captures a broad range of factors affecting performance, the results show clear benefits, particularly for developing countries, in moving forward on a broad range of fronts to improve logistics. Evidence suggests that improvements in logistics performance boost the integration of countries in global trade (box 1.3). Key findings of the 2018 international Logistics Performance Index Over the past several years, high-income countries, most of which are in Europe, occupied the top 10 positions in the LPI rankings (table 1.1). Not surprising, since these countries traditionally have been dominant in the supply chain industry. The composition of the 15 best-performing countries has not significantly changed either. But it is worth highlighting major improvements in the LPI scores of Japan, Denmark, the United Arab Emirates, and New Zealand since 2012. 10 C O N N E C T I N G T O C O M P E T E 2 0 18 T R A D E L O G I S T I C S I N T H E G L O B A L E C O N O M Y

Box 1.3 Logistics performance boosts trade integration, but by just how much? The LPI has now been available for several years, which makes it possible to estimate a trade model using more than one year of data. The approach controls for unobservable and observable factors that vary by country and time, as well as by country pair, and isolates the impact of logistics performance. Shepherd (forthcoming) implements such an approach using data for 63 exporters and importers that together account for 93 percent of world GDP and a similar proportion of world trade. Regression results show that a 1 point improvement in a country’s LPI score increases trade by 16 percent, before accounting for relative price effects. He then uses the same model to consider a catch-up scenario, in which all countries narrow the logistics gap between themselves and the leading country by 20 percent, but all other factors remain constant. Total world real GDP (a proxy for economic welfare) would increase by 0.1 percent. Trade effects would be an order of magnitude larger. In relative terms, the largest welfare gains are typi- cally in developing countries such as Cambodia (0.7 percent), Costa Rica (0.4 percent), and Tunisia (0.4 percent).

The bottom 10 countries in the ranking are mostly low-income and lower-middle-income countries in Africa or isolated areas (table 1.2). These are either fragile economies affected by armed conflict, natural disasters, and political unrest or landlocked countries naturally chal- lenged by geography or economies of scale in connecting to global supply chains. The overall group composition among the top-performing upper-middle-income econo- mies has changed marginally, with China, Thai- land, and South Africa leading the group, and Croatia and Bulgaria improving in their LPI ranking (table 1.3). Among lower-middle-income countries, large economies such as India and Indonesia and emerging economies such as Vietnam stand out as top performers. Most either have access to the sea or are located close to major transporta- tion hubs (table 1.4). Among low-income countries, countries in East and West Africa are leading performers in the 2018 report (table 1.5). Figure 1.1 displays the cumulative distribution of LPI scores. The vertical lines represent the boundaries of LPI quintiles: five groups containing the same number of countries rated in the LPI.

This means that country LPI scores are closer to each other and that any change in the country’s performance (and that of its neighbors) will generate larger changes in the ranking relative to countries in other quintiles (see box 1.2). As in previous reports, LPI scores are broken down into four categories, consistent with the score quintiles, used in all editions of Connecting to Compete: • Logistics-unfriendly: Includes countries with severe logistics constraints, such as the least developed countries (bottom LPI quintile). • Partial performers: Includes countries with a level of logistics constraints most often seen in low- and middle-income countries (third and fourth LPI quintiles). • Consistent performers: Includes countries rated better on logistics performance than most others in their income group (second LPI quintile).

• Logistics-friendly: Includes top- performing countries, most of which are in the high- income group (top LPI quintile). Logistics performance is strongly correlated with the quality of service Several trends observed in past LPI reports still hold. There are significant differences in LPI performance across LPI components and quintiles (figure 1.2). The timeliness component seems to outperform the other LPI components and is generally viewed as the least problematic. On the other hand, the performance of cus- toms and border agencies, as well as the quality of trade and transport infrastructure, are par- ticularly low in the worst-performing countries, which also have relatively low quality of logistics services. In addition, table 1.6 shows which of the six LPI components of the international LPI are above or below the overall index. A positive entry indicates that an LPI component score is higher than a group’s overall international LPI score, and a negative entry indicates that the compo- nent score is lower than the group’s overall score. Several observations stand out. Customs and bor- der agencies continue to underperform compared with other LPI components. As in past reports, except for the top quintile, the quality of trade and transport infrastructure score and the qual- ity of logistics services score are below the overall LPI score. Across the three lowest quintiles, the tracking and tracing component is a little below than the overall score, as in past reports.

High-income countries, on average, surpass low-income countries by 48 percent in their LPI scores In past reports, average country LPI scores were generally improving. But in 2018, low- income countries experienced a drop in the LPI scores for quality of infrastructure, customs performance, and quality of logistics services, as lower-middle-income countries’ scores on these three LPI components improved (figure 1.3).5 Progress can be also tracked on the envi- ronment for logistics since the last LPI edition (table 1.7). Contrary to past reports, respon- dents report improved scores for the bottom two quintiles in ICT infrastructure and in pri- vate logistics services — possibly due to ICT in- frastructure improvements in the past decade. For low-income countries, streamlining border clearance procedures and ensuring access to physical trade and transport infrastructure will continue to be priority issues. Logistics performance is more than income There is still a noticeable gap in LPI scores between high- and low-income countries. High-income countries, on average, surpass low-income countries by 48 percent in their LPI scores. Among the 30 top- performing countries, 24 are members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a proportion that has not changed much since past LPI reports. Even so, countries such as China, India, Rwanda, Thailand, and Vietnam outperform their income group peers (figure 1.4). That is why income alone cannot explain why performance varies widely among countries in certain income groups.

Trends over the past four reports The gap in relative LPI scores — the scores as a percentage of the leading country’s score — is quite similar to the gap revealed in past edi- tions of Connecting to Compete. The average relative score of the three lowest quintiles was higher than in the past three LPI reports (fig- ure 1.5). In 2018, the worst relative performer is Afghanistan, at 29.6 percent of best per- former Germany’s score. In 2016, the worst performer was the Syrian Arab Republic, at 19 percent. In 2014, the worst was Somalia, at 25 percent. The correlation between the 2016 and 2018 LPI scores is a bit stronger than those between past reports, with 0.93 in scores and 0.90 in rankings (compared with 0.91 in scores and 0.86 in rankings between 2012 and 2014). Keep in mind that the data are survey-based and thus are prone to sampling errors. Statistically significant changes are revealed only if the confidence intervals for the 2016 and 2018 scores do not overlap.

Weighted international LPI scores and ranks 2012–18 As in the past two reports, the scores of the six LPI components across the four latest surveys were used to provide a bigger and better- balanced picture of a country’s performance. This approach is believed to reduce the noise and random variation across different LPI surveys, and thus enhances the comparison of the 167 16 C O N N E C T I N G T O C O M P E T E 2 0 18 T R A D E L O G I S T I C S I N T H E G L O B A L E C O N O M Y

Despite some convergence since the 2007 LPI, the logistics gap between high- and low-income countries persists countries. In the 2018 report, the four previous scores on each component were weighted as follows: 6.7 percent for 2012, 13.3 percent for 2014, 26.7 percent for 2016, and 53.3 percent for 2018 (so the more recent data carry more weight). This method is identical to the one used in the 2014 and 2016 reports, which used the data for the prior four LPI reports. The opportunity to use weighted values is important because an individual country’s score and, consequently, its rank can oscillate a lot, even though the change might not be sta- tistically significant. That happened to several countries’ scores in 2014–16, especially those with a wide confidence interval, indicating dis- agreement among the respondents. The effect tends to be amplified if the number of observa- tions is low, as is frequent in smaller countries. Large traders, such as China, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States had confidence intervals of 0.05 score points or less in 2018, 1 percent or less of their corresponding LPI scores. By contrast, Yemen, with a confi- dence interval of 0.44, Iceland with 0.42, Niger with 0.41, and Malta with 0.39 had the largest confidence intervals, more than 13 percent of their scores. In the aggregate 2012–18 LPI, Germany scores highest at 4.19 (4.17 for the aggregate 2010–16 LPI and 4.10 for 2007–14), followed by the Netherlands 4.07 (4.12 for 2010–16 and 4.05 for 2007–14), Sweden 4.07 (4.08 for 2010–16 and 3.95 for 2007–14), Belgium 4.05 (4.06 for 2010–16 and 4.0 for 2007–14), and Singapore 4.05 (4.10 in 2010–16 and 4.06 in 2007–14). Germany and the Netherlands continue to dominate the top three, while Singapore fell from third to fifth. Of the 28 European Union member states, 15 are among the top 30 countries, and of the 34 OECD members, 24 are among the top 30. The non- OECD economies in the top 30 are Singapore (5th) Hong Kong, SAR, China (9th), United Arab Emirates (14th), Taiwan, China (24th), China (27th), South Africa (29th), and Qatar (30th). All but two of the top 30 are high- income countries; the other two, China and South Africa, are upper-middle-income countries. As in 2010–16, all OECD countries are in the top third. In the previous 2007–14 LPI ag- gregate, all European Union member states were in the top third. Bulgaria fell narrowly outside this category in the aggregate LPI scores for 2012–18 (3.0, ranked 57th) and 2010–16 (2.96, ranked 62th). Romania, by contrast, rose from a 2010–16 score of 3.05, ranked 56th, to a 2012– 18 score of 3.09, ranked 50th. In the aggregate international LPI for 2012– 18, Somalia again scores the lowest at 2.00, ranked 167th (it scored 1.67 in 2010–16 and 1.62 in 2007–14). Despite some convergence since the 2007 LPI, the logistics gap between high- and low-income countries persists. As in the previous surveys, the countries with the weakest performance in 2018 are least developed countries or small island countries, some also conflict-ridden. Haiti occupies the second- lowest rank with a score of 2.02 (it scored 1.96 in 2010–16 and 2.24 in 2007– 14). Other countries that score the lowest on logistics include Afghanistan with a score of 2.04 (2.15 in 2010–16 and 2.10 in 2007–14), Sierra Leone with 2.06 (2.04 in 2010–16 and 2.06 in 2007–14), and the Syrian Arab Republic with 2.10 (1.94 in 2010–16 and 2.31 in 2007– 14). Broadly speaking, the converging countries — ranking, roughly, from 40th to 120th — have scores separated by only a few decimal points. Thus, some large changes in rank might be witnessed in this middle ground, even though the underlying score changes are marginal. Changes in countries’ LPI scores 2016–18 Changes in the LPI score reflect negative or positive private sector perceptions of logistics performance. The LPI score is thus not purely a metric of current performance. It incorporates expectations, trends, and the perceived pace of improvement. This can create a rebound effect from one survey to the next. For example, a country with large positive changes in one survey may be adjusted downward the next time because positive changes were perceived as happening more slowly than anticipated during the preceding survey.

Note: The 2018 LPI includes 160 countries, of which 6 were not included in the 2016 edition and are thus not included in this table. Twelve countries had different income classifications in 2018 than in 2016; in all cases the 2018 classification was used. Differences in scores were rounded to two positions after the decimal point. The LPI score depends primarily on industry perceptions of relative performance. Even a country that is making improvements can see its score affected by the perceived impact or speed of improvements in other countries. Planned improvements to a country’s logistics environment can temporarily lower a country’s LPI score. For example, even if relocation from an old port to a new one is managed efficiently, it is likely that the logistics industry will expect or experience disruptions in supply chains during the adjustment. LPI assessments may also be influenced by respondents’ own experiences and the types of cargo they handle. Logistics for oil, gas, mining, or industrial projects are likely to be smoother and more homogeneous worldwide than exports of goods for local consumption, which go through traditional logistics and distribution channels. For large countries with sizable domestic markets and associated domestic logistics systems — such as China and India — the LPI is biased toward the performance of the main import gateways. It does not capture the performance of internal logistics and domestic commerce corridors linking economic centers across provincial or state boundaries. And survey respondent demographics can affect a perception-based survey such as the LPI. Score changes from one edition of the LPI to the next should be interpreted with care. However, negative trends across all years, not just two, may be something to worry about — especially when a country’s score changes by more than 20%. Connecting to Compete always includes the statistical confidence interval for each country’s International LPI (see appendix 2). Statistically significant changes occur only if the confidence intervals for the 2018 and 2016 scores do not overlap. Table 1.8 gives an overview of the number of countries in the 2018 index whose LPI score changed, either negatively or positively. While the finding is not statistically significant, it is noteworthy that slightly more low- and middle-income countries had LPI scores rise (34) than fall (30) between 2016 and 2018. 18 C O N N E C T I N G T O C O M P E T E 2 0 18 T R A D E L O G I S T I C S I N T H E G L O B A L E C O N O M Y

O I T C E S N2 Unbundling logistics performance The international Logistics Performance Index (LPI) provides insights into the drivers of over- all logistics performance. To unbundle the sur- vey results, it is necessary to refer to the domestic LPI. This section is based on the domestic LPI, where surveyed logistics professionals assess the logistics environments in countries where they work. It contains more detailed information on countries’ logistics environments, processes, and institutions and looks at the logistics con- straints within countries, not just at gateways such as ports or borders. It analyzes countries by four major determinants of overall logistics performance: infrastructure, services, border procedures, and supply chain reliability. Unless otherwise stated, data are from the 2018 survey rather than aggregate data for 2012–18. Infrastructure: A shared concern across performance groups Infrastructure is a major concern across all LPI performance groups except the top performers, but survey respondents signal improvements. The quality of information and communications technology (ICT) is consistently rated higher than physical transportation infrastructure. Table 2.1 Respondents rating the quality of each infrastructure type “high” or “very high,” by LPI quintile Percent of respondents LPI quintile Bottom quintile Fourth quintile Third quintile Second quintile Top quintile Ports Airports Roads Rail Warehousing and transloading 26 23 33 57 63 30 13 39 41 67 17 10 20 37 57 17 9 12 11 37 21 23 27 37 62 ICT 34 44 48 52 75 ICT is information and communications technology. Source: Logistics Performance Index 2018. Survey respondents in top-quintile coun- tries rated their infrastructure far more highly than those in other quintiles did (table 2.1). Dif- ferences among the other four quintiles are less striking, especially for roads and rail. The differ- ence between the top and bottom is smallest in ICT, suggesting that developing countries may have been investing heavily in modern technol- ogies, perhaps even leapfrogging intermediate stages of performance. Of course, ICT cannot replace other hard infrastructure, which re- quires a renewed focus. Though still a constraint in developing countries, infrastructure seems to be improv- ing. Since the previous LPI survey, respondents from countries in all performance quintiles generally perceive improvements in trade and transport infrastructure (figure 2.1). For the first time since the survey began, the perception of improvement is higher in the bottom quintile than in the top one, though lower in the middle. If this pattern persists, it would be consistent with some closing of the logistics gap discussed in section 1. It is also possible to compare respondents’ ratings of infrastructure with the ratings in previous LPI reports. Table 2.1 shows clear evi- dence of increasing satisfaction with port infra- structure, since scores in 2018 are higher than in previous years, as they were in 2016 compared with 2014 in most quintiles. Although for other types of infrastructure the picture is mixed and varies by quintile, these results together with respondents’ observations of improvement (see figure 2.1) clearly suggest that governments are aware of the importance of infrastructure qual- ity for logistics performance and are working successfully to improve it.

As in 2016, there is evidence of a narrowing infrastructure gap, particularly between the top quintile and the bottom one, where the rate of improvement in 2018 seems noticeably faster than in 2016; im- provement in the middle quintiles is on a par with that in earlier reports. Rail infrastruc- ture, by contrast, but also in line with previous reports, elicits general dissatisfaction. In the bottom quintile, infrastructure of all kinds fails to satisfy — an exception to the pattern in other quintiles of variation by infrastructure type. Similar patterns emerge when the domestic LPI data on infrastructure are disaggregated by World Bank region, excluding high-income countries (table 2.2). The highest ratings are for ICT in all regions except the Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean, where ICT ratings are very close to the highest. Ratings for other types of infra- structure vary more widely by region, but two features stand out. First, satisfaction with road and rail infrastructure is especially low in Latin America and the Caribbean, as in previous sur- veys, and also in South Asia, as in 2016. Second, satisfaction with rail infrastructure is low in all regions, as was the case for all LPI quintiles. Developing logistics services markets The quality and competence of core logistics service providers are two other important parts of a country’s overall performance. Respondents in all LPI quintiles are nearly always more sat- isfied with service providers than with infra- structure quality (table 2.3, compared with table 2.1). Just as for infrastructure, for service Figure 2.2 Respondents rating the quality of each infrastructure type as “high” or “very high” by LPI quintile, 2014–18 Percent 80 60 40 20 0 2018 2016 2014 Bottom quintile (lowest performance) Fourth quintile (low performance) Third quintile (average performance) Second quintile (high performance) Top quintile (highest performance) Source: Logistics Performance Index 2014, 2016, and 2018. 20 C O N N E C T I N G T O C O M P E T E 2 0 18 T R A D E L O G I S T I C S I N T H E G L O B A L E C O N O M Y

For countries in all LPI quintiles, freight forwarders are rated highly, typically at or close to the strongest scores among service providers (see table 2.3).6 Ratings for the other service pro- vider types vary more widely across all quintiles — though rail transport service provision, like rail infrastructure, consistently receives low rat- ings (see table 2.3). Rail transport aside, in the top-performing countries, service providers of all types are rated as being of high quality and competence, though the scores for consignees or shippers and for trade and transport associa- tions are lower than for most other types. A ratings gap between services and infra- structure appears generally across World Bank regions (table 2.4). It is particularly stark for air transport in Europe and Central Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, for road transport in Latin America and the Caribbean and Sub- Saharan Africa, and for warehousing in Sub- Saharan Africa. These data suggest a need to develop transport-related infrastructure, so that service markets reforms can bring maximum benefits to users. As for infrastructure performance, it is pos- sible to compare service performance over LPI years. Figure 2.3 shows performance in the bottom quintile, where improvements are par- ticularly important, over 2014–18. Across most types of service provider, respondent satisfac- tion has clearly increased. The bottom quintile is particularly important, as underdeveloped logistics services markets are often a key con- straint on performance. But figure 2.3 suggests that even in challenging environments, govern- ments and the private sector can move toward higher performance in a fairly short time. For other quintiles, results are more variable.

Breakdowns of these data by region and income group are in appendix 3, and for time and distance by country in appendix 4. These indicators provide contrasting insight into the depth of implementation of trade and trans- portation reforms. The principles of trade facilitation are widely accepted — for instance, automated submission is the norm in all per- formance groups. But lead times to import or clear goods or amounts of red tape still dif- ferentiate much between the bottom three quintiles and the two top performance tiers: for the bottom three clearance times are three times as much and paperwork twice as much as for the top two. Import and export time The time to complete trade transactions is a useful outcome measure of logistics perfor- mance. The median import lead time for port and airport supply chains, as measured for the LPI, is generally lower in higher performing groups (figure 2.4).7 It takes nearly three times as long to import in the bottom quintile as in the top quintile. This substantial gap is similar to the one in 2016. But unlike previous reports, this year’s does not show a consistent relation- ship between time and performance quintile. Instead, results for the third quintile, par- ticularly the land supply chain, seem anoma- lously high. These relationships will need to be inspected closely in future years to see whether 22 C O N N E C T I N G T O C O M P E T E 2 0 18 T R A D E L O G I S T I C S I N T H E G L O B A L E C O N O M Y

Customs procedures are becoming more similar worldwide: even the bottom quintile countries tend to adopt core customs best practices Figure 2.4 Median import time and average clearance time, by LPI quintile Days Import lead time (ports and airports) Import lead time (land) 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 Average clearance time without physical inspection Average clearance time with physical inspection Bottom quintile (lowest performance) Fourth quintile (low performance) Third quintile (average performance) Second quintile (high performance) Top quintile (highest performance) Source: Logistics Performance Index 2018. the issue is sampling error or changes in respon- dent demographics, or concrete issues of perfor- mance that need to be addressed. Importing by land takes longer than im- porting by air or sea in all LPI quintiles except the bottom one — possibly another anomalous result. The correlation between land distance and import lead time suggests that geographic hurdles — in addition to infrastructure, service provision, and other logistics issues — are impor- tant in determining a country’s ability to con- nect with world markets. Besides geography and speed en route, the efficiency of border processes affects import lead times. The time for border processes can be re- duced at all stages, but especially clearing goods on arrival (see figure 2.4). Although the time to clear goods through customs is a small frac- tion of total import time for all LPI quintiles, it rises sharply if goods are physically inspected, even in high-performing countries. Core cus- toms procedures are similar across quintiles. But physical inspection is far more prevalent in low-performing countries, which may even sub- ject the same shipment to repeated inspections by multiple agencies (table 2.5). Countries with low logistics performance need to cut red tape, physical inspections, and excessive and opaque procedural requirements. Export supply chains typically have a much lighter procedural burden than import supply chains, so lead times are shorter for exports Table 2.5 Respondents indicating that listed customs procedures are available and being used, by LPI quintile Percent of respondents, unless otherwise indicated Customs procedure Bottom quintile Fourth quintile Third quintile Second quintile Top quintile Online processing of customs declaration Requirement that a licensed customs broker be used for clearance Choice of location of final clearance Release with guarantee pending final clearance Physical inspection of import shipments (percent of shipments) Multiple physical inspections of import shipments Source: Logistics Performance Index 2018. 76 100 63 61 33 18 94 81 67 52 29 11 83 57 81 50 20 11 92 86 74 69 17 3 95 67 75 64 9 5 C O N N E C T I N G T O C O M P E T E 2 0 18 T R A D E L O G I S T I C S I N T H E G L O B A L E C O N O M Y 23

than for imports (figure 2.5). Export lead times for overall logistics performance have generally declined, but not for land supply chains in the third and fourth quintiles, an anomalous re- sult that will need to be monitored in future reports. The familiar logistics gap between income groups appears again for export lead times, which are nearly four times as long for low- as for high-income countries (figure 2.6). That gap is far wider than in previous editions, perhaps due to a different locational composi- tion of survey respondents. Export times for land supply chains differ much more between low-income countries and the rest than between middle- and high-income countries. Many low- income countries have long export lead times, hurting their export competitiveness and ability to trade internationally. Unlike lead times, customs procedures are becoming more similar worldwide (see table 2.5). Even the bottom quintile countries tend to adopt core customs best practices. Even as customs procedures gradually im- prove, customs is not the only agency in border management in many countries, and the other agencies constrain supply chain performance.

Previous editions stressed that for many countries, the key to improving border agency performance may lie with reforms to agencies other than customs. There is evidence that some countries have been moving forward on this agenda, though the data will need to be monitored in future years to see whether the trend continues. It remains important to look beyond cus- toms when designing trade facilitation reforms. Fewer inspection procedures are required for products that are not perishable or time sensi- tive. Health and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) agencies have been slow to automate, al- though that may be changing. Cooperation among all agencies — standards, transport, vet- erinary, and health/SPS — is critical to reform. So is introducing modern approaches to regula- tory compliance. Whereas customs performance has re- mained constant across the board since the 2014 LPI report, quality and standards/inspection agencies have improved considerably in lower quintiles. Figures 2.7 and 2.8 show a clear trend toward greater satisfaction with them. Red tape Indicators for red tape show a continuing lack of border coordination, resulting in a burden on private logistics operators similar to the one in previous editions. In countries in the bottom quintile, operators typically deal with around twice as many government agencies and Figure 2.7 Respondents rating the quality and competence of quality and inspection agencies as “high” or “very high,” by LPI quintile, 2014–18 Percent 60 40 20 0 2018 2016 2014 Bottom quintile (lowest performance) Fourth quintile (low performance) Third quintile (average performance) Second quintile (high performance) Top quintile (highest performance) Source: Logistics Performance Index 2014, 2016, and 2018.

Countries in the top quintile typically require two sup- porting documents for trade transactions, and those in the bottom, four to five — a persistent logistics gap in the previous and current LPIs. Simplifying documentation for imports and exports has long been high on the trade facilita- tion agenda, prompting initiatives to bring bor- der agencies together and create a single window for trade. The World Bank and International Fi- nance Corporation’s Doing Business indicators place great weight on such simplification. Still, steps in other aspects of border management and, more generally, soft and hard trade-related infrastructure are also needed. The World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade Facilitation (TFA) can help in two areas. First, its standards are sub- ject to the WTO’s binding trade disciplines, unlike previous conventions, although devel- oping countries remain free to select which parts of the TFA will become immediately binding, which will be deferred, and which Figure 2.9 Red tape affecting import and export transactions, by LPI quintile Number of procedures Import agencies Export agencies Import documents Export documents 5 4 3 2 1 0 Bottom quintile (lowest performance) Fourth quintile (low performance) Third quintile (average performance) Second quintile (high performance) Top quintile (highest performance) Source: Logistics Performance Index 2014, 2016, and 2018. 26 C O N N E C T I N G T O C O M P E T E 2 0 18 T R A D E L O G I S T I C S I N T H E G L O B A L E C O N O M Y

Predictable, reliable supply chains are central to good logistics performance; highly uncertain lead times can disrupt production and exporting will apply only once technical assistance is re- ceived. Second, to support this framework, the TFA strengthens the delivery of technical assis- tance and capacity-building support for devel- oping and least developed countries. Many of the agreement’s measures are relatively straight- forward to implement, while others, such as in- troducing national single-window systems, can be quite complex and will require sustained ef- fort from governments. Supply chain reliability: A key concern for all countries Logistics performance is strongly associated with supply chain reliability and predictable shipment delivery. The causes of delays identi- fied in the survey are more worrisome in the three bottom performance quintiles than in the top performers or even the second quintile. Some causes of delays or unreliability are en- dogenous to a country’s supply chain: the qual- ity of service and the cost and speed of clearance processes are examples. But other causes, such as dependence on indirect maritime routes, lie outside the domestic supply chain and are not under a country’s control. The LPI details possible causes of delay not directly related to how domestic services and agencies perform (table 2.7). Again, the con- trast is striking between the top and bottom LPI quintiles, especially in three areas: informal (corrupt) payments, compulsory warehousing, and preshipment inspection. The first two over- lap with the problems identified in previous LPI reports. Since the 2016 report, reported delays in the bottom quintile declined considerably, consistent with the lower prevalence of most kinds of delays in the bottom quintile than in the middle ones. It is hoped that this important change reflects catching up, and monitoring the trend in future reports will be important. Despite clear improvements, delays and un- expected costs are more common in bottom quintile countries than the top performers, un- dermining overall supply chain performance. Worse, across LPI quintiles the incidence of delays is generally increasing, except in the low- est quintile in some cases. The general pattern suggests that supply chain predictability is an acute commercial problem but may be moving in the right direction in the lowest-performing countries. Predictable, reliable supply chains are cen- tral to good logistics performance. Indeed, highly uncertain lead times can disrupt pro- duction and exporting, forcing firms to adopt costly strategies such as express shipping or sharply higher inventories, eroding competi- tiveness within global and regional value chains that use just-in-time production. Although firms can adopt strategies, such as building in redundancies to deal with disruptions affecting one supplier, countries that want their firms to join, and move up in, global and regional value chains must provide the conditions for predict- able, reliable supply chains. An additional reason for policy makers to focus greater attention on supply chain re- liability and predictability is the emerging networked structure of global and regional trade, linked in part to the rise of value chains. In a network, small disruptions at one link can spread rapidly and sometimes unpredictably to Table 2.7 Respondents reporting that shipments are “often” or “nearly always” delayed, by delay category and LPI quintile Percent of respondents LPI quintile Bottom quintile Fourth quintile Third quintile Second quintile Top quintile Source: Logistics Performance Index 2018.

In the top quintile, most respondents report that import and export shipments “always” or “nearly always” arrive on schedule, but in the bottom quintile, only around half as many do other links. The efficiency gains associated with networked production models thus come with increased systemic risk, because the structure itself can be vulnerable to small shocks affect- ing crucial links. Countries that cannot pro- vide the conditions for developing predictable and reliable supply chains will become increas- ingly disconnected from world markets, where networked production models are common. Low- performing countries need greater policy attention to improve their connectivity and to stem any further marginalization in the global trading system. Supply chain reliability and predictability are further reflected in a key performance met- ric from the domestic LPI, timeliness of clear- ance and delivery (figure 2.10). Given that the frequency of delays tends to rise with declining logistics performance, it is unsurprising that the timeliness of clearance and delivery gener- ally suffers as one moves down the LPI quintiles. In the top quintile, most respondents report that import and export shipments “always” or “nearly always” arrive on schedule, but in the bottom quintile, only around half as many do. However, compared with the 2016 LPI report, performance in the low and middle quintiles is noticeably improved, so some convergence is taking place. This finding again highlights the importance of low-performing countries taking steps to improve predictability and reliability of supply chains, to continue narrowing this part of the logistics gap. The fourth LPI quintile has the largest dif- ference between on-schedule arrival rates for ex- ports and those for imports (see figure 2.10), as in the previous LPI report. The bottom quintile has a substantially narrower gap. A lower rate of favorable survey responses for imports sug- gests that supply chain unreliability discrimi- nates in practice (if not in law) against foreign goods. As traditional trade barriers continue to fall around the world, policies contributing to such other barriers become ever larger deter- minants of performance and trade outcomes. So, addressing the causes of unexpected delays — including unpredictability in clearance, in- land transit delays, and low service reliability — should be an important part of logistics reform in low-performing countries. The patterns for supply chain reliability are more striking in some World Bank regions than others (figure 2.11). The geographic predictabil- ity gap may influence competitiveness and the spread of regional supply chains and produc- tion networks. However, caution is appropriate in approaching figure 2.11 because the data vary considerably from one year to another, in part Figure 2.10 Respondents reporting that shipments are “often” or “nearly always” cleared and delivered as scheduled, by LPI quintile Imports Respondents reporting that shipments are “often” or “nearly always” cleared and delivered as scheduled, by LPI quintile Exports 100 75 50 25 0 Bottom quintile (lowest performance) Fourth quintile (low performance) Third quintile (average performance) Second quintile (high performance) Top quintile (highest performance) Source: Logistics Performance Index 2018. 28 C O N N E C T I N G T O C O M P E T E 2 0 18 T R A D E L O G I S T I C S I N T H E G L O B A L E C O N O M Y

Supply chain quality is not just a matter of time and cost. A further consideration — for private sector operators and their clients — is shipment predictability, which varied widely in the 2018 LPI, as in previous reports (figure 2.12). In the top LPI quintile, just 13 percent of shipments fail to meet company quality criteria — the same proportion as previously. Twice as many shipments in the bottom quintile fail to meet company quality criteria. However, perfor- mance in the bottom quintile has improved no- ticeably since the 2016 LPI, while the result for the fourth quintile appears anomalous — it has the highest percentage failing to meet company quality criteria. This finding again illustrates that the logistics gap is real but perhaps narrow- ing from an overall perspective of supply chain efficiency and reliability. The most important quality criterion in freight forwarding is delivery within the Figure 2.12 Shipments not meeting company quality criteria, by LPI quintile Percent 40 30 20 10 0 Bottom quintile (lowest performance) Fourth quintile (low performance) Third quintile (average performance) Second quintile (high performance) Top quintile (highest performance) Source: Logistics Performance Index 2018.

promised time window. Almost as important is the absence of errors in cargo composition or documentation. The window of acceptable qual- ity is much narrower, and errors are much less tolerated, in high-performing countries than in low-performing countries. The shipment quality gap only partly reflects these differing expectations. 30 C O N N E C T I N G T O C O M P E T E 2 0 18 T R A D E L O G I S T I C S I N T H E G L O B A L E C O N O M Y

Logistics trends, reform implementation, and the Logistics Performance Index O I T C E S N3 The global logistics landscape displays positive trends, even though disparities remain between the top performers and many developing coun- tries. In developing countries, the logistics agenda appears even more prominent today than it was in 2007, as interventions expand with changes in demand, changes in industry, and the increasingly central role of sustainabil- ity-related concerns. Often motivated by the Logistics Performance Index, national gov- ernments and regional groups are promoting reform. And international organizations — the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the World Bank, and regional development banks — are supporting them. The LPI: Stimulating and informing reforms Since their inception, the LPI and its concep- tual framework have motivated comprehensive reforms, as in India and Oman (for Oman, see box 3.3 below). Since 2016, India has empha- sized logistics among its high-priority economic reforms to meet challenges of large country size, congested hubs, and internal barriers to trading good and services. To complement the ground- breaking unification of the sales tax across states, the government of India appointed a Special Secretary for logistics, in charge of cross- cutting policies and coordination. And in 2018, the government commissioned a subnational LPI, applying the World Bank LPI concept.8 The LPI and related datasets produced at the World Bank9 are widely used as inputs for analytical policy work and in academic research in areas such as transportation, operations re- search, and trade (box 3.1). Shifting priorities Global logistics has changed in big ways since the first LPI report. The 2008–09 trade crunch that ended an era of fast growing international trade put pressure on traditional actors. And new players and new business models, such as e-commerce, have emerged. Technology and new concerns about supply chain resilience drive industry changes and reshape the policy agenda. Megatrends and policies A recent publication by the World Economic Forum, prepared by leading experts, identified eight megatrends likely to drive the future of logistics: 1. Logistics skill shortages. 2. Restructuring global value chains. 3. Supply risk and recovery (resilience). 4. Digital transformation of supply chains. 5. Sustainability of supply chains. 6. E-commerce driving demand chains. 7. Logistics property and infrastructure. 8. Collaborative business models.10 Most of these trends are directly relevant for the logistics policy agenda. So, the 2018 LPI survey asked about the drivers of change for freight forwarding services. Most respondents across country income groups see the demand for services growing, fueled by the expansion of e-commerce (figure 3.1). The importance of skill development for logistics Despite extensive mechanization and auto- mation, logistics remains a people business. Logistics at an operational level is labor- intensive, with many blue-collar workers (such as truck drivers and warehouse operators) and C O N N E C T I N G T O C O M P E T E 2 0 18 T R A D E L O G I S T I C S I N T H E G L O B A L E C O N O M Y 31

Yet human resources, often overlooked or taken for granted, depend not only on the policies of com- panies but also on national initiatives to educate and train people for logistics occupations. In 2017, the World Bank and the Kühne Logistics University published a report on skills, competencies, and training in the logis- tics sector.11 It highlighted a general perception that qualified logistics-related labor is in short supply at all levels in both developed and devel- oping countries, suggesting that the problem is likely to remain or worsen over the next five years. Respondents in developing countries see the most severe skill shortage at the managerial level — for example, in filling senior supply chain management positions. In developed countries, the most severe shortage is for a qualified blue- collar workforce, such as truck drivers. Reasons for the shortages include the low prestige and status of operational logistics workers. The sector offers comparatively low salaries, leading to an inferior position in the war for talent. Many developing countries, even if they suffer from high unemployment, have a limited supply of skilled labor. Logistics devel- opments, particularly in information technol- ogy, demand new competencies that the work- force does not possess.

Voca- tional schools for logistics jobs are lacking. And training — if there is any — is limited to short- term, on-the-job instruction by colleagues dur- ing daily operations. This failure disproportion- ally affects the young, an untapped reservoir of apprentices. National governments and international agencies have traditionally paid more attention to infrastructure and trade facilitation than to fostering quality services and a skilled work- force. Employees are hired by private companies, and their training is largely a private responsi- bility. But governments play an important role directly by regulating or providing training — and indirectly by facilitating private initiatives. Developing countries need a major expansion of logistics training and skill development initia- tives. Public interventions promoting logistics competence include the following: • Education and training by public institu- tions, or financial support to training. • Education policy and curricula develop- ment. • Advocacy, public–private dialogue, and multi-stakeholder collaboration. • Regulation of freight and logistics services, including customs brokerage and trucking. • Setting and harmonizing competency stan- dards for different jobs. • • Raising skill levels in state-owned logistics enterprises (typically ports and railways). Investing in human capital as a compo- nent of the development of logistics and freight infrastructure. As part of its country work, the World Bank recently began to offer a comprehensive assess- ment of skills and competencies at the national level to support logistics improvements (box 3.2). It pinpoints labor skills and constraints in logistics jobs and suggests priorities for inter- vention to upgrade skills. Supply chain resilience Commerce and production have been dis- rupted by natural events and man-made disasters, such as civil wars or, recently, cyber- disasters. In the current era of globalization, extended supply chains have created more interdependence. Local events create dis- turbances much beyond the area directly affected when supply chains are interrupted with no backup. In 2010, the eruptions of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland grounded most European air transportation for weeks and broke the air cargo export supply chains of many African developing countries for sev- eral weeks. In 2011, the tsunami in Japan and the floods in Thailand disrupted trade by strik- ing key nodes of global value chains. In such severe events, supply chain links can take a long time to rebuild and may even be perma- nently altered. The resilience of international and domes- tic supply chains is thus emerging as a policy concern, requiring measures by government agencies and private companies, as in Canada, Japan, the Nordic countries, and the United States. In mid-2017, cyberattacks on global providers created significant physical supply chain disruption for weeks, so the 2018 LPI survey included a question on the importance of resilience in cybersecurity. The perceived magnitude of cyberthreat and preparedness C O N N E C T I N G T O C O M P E T E 2 0 18 T R A D E L O G I S T I C S I N T H E G L O B A L E C O N O M Y 33

to respond go hand in hand, and developing countries lag behind (figures 3.2 and 3.3). (figure 3.4). This trend is good news, as logis- tics has a fairly large footprint not only on the economy but also on the environment. Environmental sustainability of logistics This edition of Connecting to Compete, like the three previous editions, included a question on the demand for environmentally friendly international logistics.

Asking for green logistics? Emissions from all logistics activities are hard to measure, but transport offers a good proxy: 23 percent of all energy-related emissions can be attributed to transport,12 and about 7 percent of global CO2 emissions can be attributed to freight transport,13 which is estimated to have emitted 3.2 gigatons of CO2 in 2015.14 This number is estimated to rise in the next decades, with a higher growth in emerging economies than in Europe. In top-quintile countries, 28 percent of respondents indicated in 2018 that shippers often or nearly always ask for environmentally friendly shipping options — in emission levels and choices of routes, vehicles, and schedules (down from 34 percent in 2016). The share drops to 14 percent in second-quintile coun- tries, and then steadily declines in the third (9 percent), fourth (7 percent) and fifth (5 per- cent) quintiles (see figure 3.4). The picture is slightly more balanced for re- spondents answering that shippers “sometimes” ask for environmentally sustainable shipping options, ranging from 27 percent in the top quintile and 21 percent in the bottom one.

Reducing the logistics footprint Decarbonization measures can curb the detri- mental effect of freight transport. They include improved asset utilization in logistics (such as for storage and handling), higher energy effi- ciency of road and rail freight, low-carbon energy for ships (such as biofuels), fuel efficiency in air cargo, and modal shifts (a moving higher proportion of freight to modes with lower car- bon intensity). 15 Climate change mitigation also features in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted in September 2015. While transport and logistics are not explicitly named, they influence several of the 17 SDGs: 7, affordable and clean energy; 9, industry, in- novation, and infrastructure; 11, sustainable cities and communities; 12, responsible con- sumption and production; and 13, climate action. Several organizations focused on specific modes of transport (road, rail, air, and mari- time, including seaports) reference the SDGs. They include the International Civil Aviation Organization in its 2030 Agenda for Sustain- able Development through promoting sustain- able air transport.16 For maritime shipping, the International Maritime Organization for- mulates maritime policies and in April 2018 adopted an initial strategy to halve emissions from maritime transport by 2050 from the 2008 level.17 In addition, the worldwide port industry launched its SDG initiative called the World C O N N E C T I N G T O C O M P E T E 2 0 18 T R A D E L O G I S T I C S I N T H E G L O B A L E C O N O M Y 35

While the development of connecting infrastructure remains a central concern, middle-income countries have to deal with an increasingly complex set of policies Ports Sustainability Program in March 2018.18 The road transport industry is recognizing the SDG, too: its primary organization, the Inter- national Road Transport Union, is promoting the agenda among its members and in coopera- tion with relevant bodies, such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.19 Other international bodies that have green logistics and transport on their agenda include the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Transport Forum (ITF), both linked to the OECD.20 The IEA’s guidance for countries to reduce dependence on oil and greenhouse gas emissions runs under the theme, “Avoid, Shift, Improve.” Its recent transport policy reports include “The Future of Trucks,” which highlights how improved efficiency and alternative truck fuels can help meet environ- mental objectives,21 and the “Global EV Out- look 2017,” which features recent developments of electric vehicles as well as market and policy implications.22 The ITF launched its “Decarbonizing Transport” initiative in 2016, with the goal of achieving zero transport emissions around 2050. At the heart of the project are tools to en- able decisionmakers to select the most fitting CO2 reduction measures. The initiative focuses on assessing the impacts of CO2 reducing mea- sures, not on advocating specific measures. Country-level examples include the Nordic countries — Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Nor- way, and Sweden — which have embraced the goal of being fossil free by 2050.23 While 87 per- cent of electricity generated across the Nordic countries is already carbon-free, several chal- lenges remain: the variability of wind energy in Denmark, the reliance on biomass and forestry products in Finland, and the investments in oil and hydropower in Norway. The logistics footprint is also spatial, requir- ing large land areas for facilities such as ware- houses, and transport connections to and from them. Logistics not only competes for space with industry and commerce, but also gener- ates traffic in high-density areas. With grow- ing urbanization in developing countries, rap- idly increasing urban freight transport has a big impact economically (inefficiencies and urban competitiveness), environmentally (air pollu- tion and noise), and socially (quality of life and health). Hence, the sharper focus on urban lo- gistics and the spatial planning of logistics facili- ties, as in logistics centers and zones. Managing the complexity of implementation The initial focus of logistics related reform emphasized building connecting infrastructure and facilitating trade at the border. That tradi- tional agenda remains important for developing countries, especially for low logistics performers (see section 2), and is still at the core of interven- tions of international organizations. Connecting infrastructure in developing countries is a high priority of development partners. It is also tar- geted by the major connectivity initiatives such as the Belt and Road. Trade facilitation good practices have been spelled out in documents and conventions by specialized international organi- zations such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe and the World Cus- toms Organization since the 1970s. Regulatory reforms of the logistics services sectors are also key to logistics performance, as advocated in pre- vious editions of Connecting to Compete. Regula- tory improvements aim to enhance the quality of service delivery, building on market mechanisms and private sector participation. These reforms are nevertheless challenging to implement in many developing countries. They deal with sec- tors such as trucking, brokerage, and terminal or warehousing operations, which in many places operate with limited efficiency and with barriers to modernization or entry of new services. The emerging policy areas, such as resilience and urban logistics, are at least as relevant to de- veloping countries as to developed countries. The network nature of logistics means that stan- dards and business models applicable in high- performing countries will soon appear in lower- performing countries. Managing logistics as a sector of the economy Countries aiming at improving their logistics performance must see logistics as a cross-cutting 36 C O N N E C T I N G T O C O M P E T E 2 0 18 T R A D E L O G I S T I C S I N T H E G L O B A L E C O N O M Y

policy concern. The work crosses administrative boundaries of transportation, commerce, infra- structure, industry, finance, and the environ- ment. And it requires mechanisms to involve the private sector (box 3.3). The complexity of the agenda is likely to challenge countries in the second and third LPI performance tiers most. Their policy- making has to reconcile the need for consistency and depth of reforms with a set of priorities wider than those facing top performers, which are far- ther along, or countries in the two bottom tiers, which can focus on fewer issues. National logistics bodies exist in several countries. They help address the cross-cutting nature of logistics, set common strategies, in- sure consistency across sectors, and address gaps not crossed by other agencies. China has a large government-related Federation of Logistics and Purchasing. Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries have consultative bodies to develop and refine national strategies. Morocco set up a dedicated agency in 2013 to promote the logistics sector. Dinalog in the Netherlands — a partnership of the private sector, academia, and government agencies with shared funding — develops strategy, promotes innovation, con- solidates knowledge and data, and facilitates investments.24 Another question is the legal and regulatory status of logistics as a sector of the economy. Logistics encompasses specific activities, cre- ates new concerns because of its footprint, and brings new types of services. Very specific logis- tics regulations apply to services, to movements of goods, and to facilities and assets. But tradi- tional transport, commerce, urban, and fiscal provisions rarely consider logistics as an activ- ity or service. Many countries with an emerging modern logistics sectors are promoting a frame- work law to clarify the status of logistics and to improve consistency with other regulatory Box 3.3 Logistics policy making in Oman In response to declining hydrocarbon revenues and a rising need along four pillars: markets, trade facilitation, human capital, and to diversify away from oil, Oman is improving its logistics perfor- technology applications. mance.

Greece and Morocco have done so re- cently. Despite limited experience, a framework legal instrument should be carefully evaluated. Informing reforms with data Data are essential for motivating, designing, and monitoring policy changes. Logistics observa- tories, implemented in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, typically rely on national surveys and the maintenance of a few key performance indi- cators based on existing data.25 One of the biggest changes since the 2007 Connecting to Compete is a quantum shift of country-specific logistics data from scarce to abundant. The automation of supply chain pro- cessing and the spread of tracking and tracing almost globally provide micro-level data on logistics that can be used to evaluate not only international gateways and corridors but also supply chain connectivity within countries. Transforming the massive raw data on individ- ual movements into relevant decision-oriented dashboards is a major technical and organiza- tional challenge, with limited experience so far and few established methodologies or guide- lines. Exceptions include South Africa and Canada, which have performance-monitoring systems for their internal logistics networks based on micro- logistics data.26 And Finland’s large-scale biennial national logistics surveys are in the public domain.27 * * * More advanced economies deal with a broader array of policies addressing the performance and externalities of domestic supply chains than lower logistics performers.

The ranking of countries by LPI score uses the weighted aggregate value of the scores from the four most recent LPI surveys, with greatest weight given to 2018. This reduces the noise and random variation across different editions of LPI surveys to provide a more balanced picture. Boston Consulting Group 2016. In 2018, the number of respondents from low-Income countries was smaller than in 2016 (but close to the number in 2014). This may have generated more “noise” in the 2018 data, so the findings should be treated with caution. The respondents in the LPI survey are freight forwarders and express carriers, so the quality and competence of these service providers are assessed by their peers. Lead time to import is the median time for shipments from port of discharge to arrival at the consignee.

Central African Republic Bhutan Cuba Lesotho Burundi Libya Equatorial Guinea Mauritania Gabon Iraq Angola Zimbabwe Eritrea Syrian Arab Republic Sierra Leone Afghanistan Haiti Somalia Source: Logistics Performance Index 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018. Note: The LPI index is a multidimensional assessment of logistics performance, rated on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The six core components captured by the LPI survey are rated by respondents on a scale of 1–5, where 1 is very low or very difficult and 5 is very high or very easy, except for question 15, where 1 is hardly ever and 5 is nearly always. The relative LPI score is obtained by normalizing the LPI score: Percentage of highest performer = 100 × [LPI – 1] / [LPI highest – 1]. Thus, the best performer has the maximum relative LPI score of 100 percent. C O N N E C T I N G T O C O M P E T E 2 0 18 T R A D E L O G I S T I C S I N T H E G L O B A L E C O N O M Y 43

Appendix 1 Aggregated international LPI results Methodology for computing the aggregated International LPI Scores of the six components across the four most recent LPI surveys were used to generate a “big picture” to better indicate countries’ logistics performance. This approach reduces random variation from one LPI survey to another and enables the comparison of 167 countries. Each year’s scores in each component were given weights: 6.7 percent for 2012, 13.3 percent for 2014, 26.7 percent for 2016, and 53.3 percent for 2018. In this way, the most recent data carry the highest weight. We compute aggregated the score over 2018, 2016, 2014, and 2012 in the following way. First, we fill missing values, according to: Score14 = Score12 if Score 14 is missing Score16 = Score14 if Score 16 is missing Score18 = Score16 if Score 18 is missing Then: Score16 = Score18 if Score 16 is still missing Score14 = Score16 if Score 14 is still missing Score12 = Score14 if Score 12 is missing For example, the following table: Score18 Score16 Score14 Score12 a1 b1 . . e1 a2 . c2 . e2 a3 b3 . d3 . . . c4 d4 . would be extrapolated in this way: Score18 Score16 Score14 Score12 a1 b1 c2 d3 e1 a2 b3 c2 d3 e2 a3 b3 c4 d3 e2 a3 b3 c4 d4 e2 Second, we weight the values in the following way: Consolidated score = 8w*Score18 + 4w*Score16 + 2w*Score14 + w*Score12 So that: w = 0.067, 2w = 0.133, 4w = 0.267, 8w = 0.533. 44 C O N N E C T I N G T O C O M P E T E 2 0 18 T R A D E L O G I S T I C S I N T H E G L O B A L E C O N O M Y

The six core components captured by the LPI survey are rated by respondents on a scale of 1–5, where 1 is very low or very difficult and 5 is very high or very easy, except for question 15, where 1 is hardly ever and 5 is nearly always. The relative LPI score is obtained by normalizing the LPI score: Percentage of highest performer = 100 × [LPI – 1] / [LPI highest – 1]. Thus, the best performer has the maximum relative LPI score of 100 percent.

I D N E P P A X5 The LPI methodology Because logistics has many dimensions, mea- suring and summarizing performance across countries is challenging. Examining the time and costs associated with logistics processes — port processing, customs clearance, transport, and the like — is a good start, and in many cases this information is readily available. But even when complete, this information can- not be easily aggregated into a single, consis- tent, cross-country dataset, because of struc- tural differences in countries’ supply chains. Even more important, many critical elements of good logistics — such as process transpar- ency and service quality, predictability, and reliability — cannot be assessed using only time and cost information. Constructing the international LPI The first part of the LPI survey (questions 10–15) provides the raw data for the international LPI. Each survey respondent rates eight overseas mar- kets on six core components of logistics perfor- mance. The eight countries are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the country where the respondent is located, on random selection, and — for landlocked countries — on neighboring countries that form part of the land bridge connecting them with international markets. The method used to select the group of countries rated by each respondent varies by the characteristics of the country where the respondent is located (table A5.1). Table A5.1 Methodology for selecting country groups for survey respondents Respondents from low-income countries Respondents from middle-income countries Respondents from high-income countries Respondents from coastal countries Five most important export partner countries + Three most important import partner countries Respondents from landlocked countries Four most important export partner countries + Two most important import partner countries + Two land-bridge countries Source: Authors.

Respondents take the survey online. For the 2018 edition, the survey was open between Sep- tember 2017 and February 2018. The web en- gine for 2018 was the same as the new engine put in place in 2012. It incorporates the Uni- form Sampling Randomized (USR) approach to gain the most possible responses from under- represented countries. Because the survey en- gine relies heavily on a specialized country se- lection methodology for survey respondents based on high trade volume between countries, the USR can help countries with lower trade volumes rise to the top during country selection. The 2017–18 survey engine builds a set of countries for the survey respondents that are subject to the rule set (see table A5.1). After 200 surveys, the USR is introduced into the engine’s process for country selection. For each new survey respondent, the USR solicits a re- sponse from a country chosen at random but with non-uniform probability — with weights chosen to evolve the sampling toward uniform probability. Specifically, a country i is chosen with a probability (N – ni) / 2N, where ni is the Table A5.2 Results of principal component analysis for the International LPI 2018 Component Eigenvalue Difference Proportion Cumulative 1 2 3 4 5 6 5.53535 0.17175 0.106876 0.0776582 0.0696941 0.0386757 5.36359 0.0648739 0.0292183 0.00796402 0.0310184 na 0.9226 0.0286 0.0178 0.0129 0.0116 0.0064 0.9226 0.9512 0.9690 0.9819 0.9936 1.0000 Source: World Bank staff analysis.

The international LPI is a summary indica- tor of logistics sector performance, combining data on six core performance components into a single aggregate measure. Some respondents did not provide information for all six components, so interpolation is used to fill in missing values. The missing values are replaced with the coun- try mean response for each question, adjusted by the respondent’s average deviation from the country mean in the answered questions. The six core components are: • The efficiency of customs and border manage- ment clearance, rated from “very low” (1) to “very high” (5) in survey question 10. • The quality of trade and transport infrastruc- ture, rated from “very low” (1) to “very high” (5) in survey question 11. • The ease of arranging competitively priced shipments, rated from “very difficult” (1) to “very easy” (5) in survey question 12. • The competence and quality of logistics serv- ices, rated from “very low” (1) to “very high” (5) in survey question 13. • The ability to track and trace consignments, rated from “very low” (1) to “very high” (5) in survey question 14. • The frequency with which shipments reach consignees within scheduled or expected de- livery times, rated from “hardly ever” (1) to “nearly always” (5) in survey question 15. The LPI is constructed from these six indica- tors using principal component analysis (PCA), a standard statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset. In the LPI, the inputs for PCA are country scores on questions 10–15, averaged across all respondents provid- ing data on a given overseas market. Scores are normalized by subtracting the sample mean and dividing by the standard deviation before con- ducting PCA. The output from PCA is a single indicator — the LPI — that is a weighted average of those scores. The weights are chosen to maxi- mize the percentage of variation in the LPI’s original six indicators that is accounted for by the summary indicator. Full details of the PCA procedure are in ta- bles A5.2 and A5.3. The first line of table A5.2

shows that the first (principal) eigenvalue of the correlation matrix of the six core indicators is greater than one — and much larger than any other eigenvalue. Standard statistical tests, such as the Kaiser Criterion and the eigenvalue scree plot, suggest that a single principal component be retained to summarize the underlying data. This principal component is the international LPI. Table A5.2 shows that the international LPI accounts for 92 percent of the variation in the six components. To construct the international LPI, normal- ized scores for each of the six original indicators are multiplied by their component loadings (table A5.3) and then summed. The component load- ings represent the weight given to each original indicator in constructing the international LPI. Since the loadings are similar for all six, the in- ternational LPI is close to a simple average of the indicators. Although PCA is re-run for each ver- sion of the LPI, the weights remain very steady from year to year. There is thus a high degree of comparability across the various LPI editions. Constructing the confidence intervals To account for the sampling error created by the LPI’s survey-based methodology, LPI scores are presented with approximate 80 percent confi- dence intervals. These intervals make it possible to provide upper and lower bounds for a coun- try’s LPI score and rank. To determine whether a change in score or a difference between two scores is statistically significant, confidence inter- vals must be examined carefully. For example, a statistically significant improvement in a coun- try’s performance should not be concluded unless the lower bound of the country’s 2018 LPI score exceeds the upper bound of its 2016 score. To calculate the confidence interval, the standard error of LPI scores across all respon- dents is estimated for a country. The upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval are then s is the estimated standard error of each coun- try’s LPI score, and t is Student’s t-distribution. As a result of this approach, confidence inter- vals and low-high ranges for scores and ranks are larger for small markets with few respondents, since these estimates are less certain. The high and low scores are used to calculate upper and lower bounds on country ranks. The upper bound is the LPI rank a country would receive if its LPI score were at the upper bound of the confidence interval rather than at the cen- ter. The lower bound is the LPI rank a country would receive if its LPI score were at the lower bound of the confidence interval rather than at the center. In both cases, the scores of all other countries are kept constant. The average confidence interval on the 1–5 scale is 0.2, or about 7 percent of the average country’s LPI score. Because of the bunching of LPI scores in the middle of the distribution, the confidence interval translates into an average of 16 rank places, using upper and lower rank bounds as calculated above. Caution must be taken when interpreting small differences in LPI scores and rankings. Despite being the most comprehensive data source for country logistics and trade facilita- tion, the LPI has two important limitations. First, the experience of international freight for- warders might not represent the broader logistics environment in poor countries, which often rely on traditional operators. And the international and traditional operators might differ in their interactions with government agencies — and in their service levels. Second, for landlocked countries and small-island states, the LPI might reflect access problems outside the country as- sessed, such as transit difficulties. The low rating of a landlocked country might not adequately re- flect its trade facilitation efforts, which depend on the workings of complex international transit systems. Landlocked countries cannot eliminate transit inefficiencies with domestic reforms.

qualitative and quantitative information on the logistics environment in the country where they work. Questions 17–22 ask respondents to choose one of five performance categories. In question 17, for example, they can describe port charges in their country as “very high,” “high,” “aver- age,” “low,” or “very low.” As in the international LPI, these options are coded from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). Appendix 3 displays country averages of the percentage of respondents rating each as- pect of the logistics environment as 1–2 or 4–5. Question 23 referred to the use of electronic platforms in logistics and to cyberthreats. With a few exceptions, questions 24–35 ask respondents for quantitative information on their countries’ international supply chains, offering choices in a dropdown menu. When a response indicates a single value, the answer is coded as the logarithm of that value. When a response indicates a range, the answer is coded as the logarithm of the midpoint of that range. For example, export distance can be indicated as less than 50 kilometers, 50–100 kilometers, 100– 500 kilometers, and so forth — so a response of 50–100 kilometers is coded as log(75). Full de- tails of the coding matrix are available on request. Country scores are produced by exponen- tiating the average of responses in logarithms across all respondents for a given country. This method is equivalent to taking a geometric aver- age in levels. Scores for regions, income groups, and LPI quintiles are simple averages of the rel- evant country scores. 62 C O N N E C T I N G T O C O M P E T E 2 0 18 T R A D E L O G I S T I C S I N T H E G L O B A L E C O N O M Y

I D N E P P A X6 Respondent demographics Operators on the ground are best placed to assess the vital aspects of logistics performance. The LPI thus uses a structured online survey of logistics professionals at multinational freight forwarders and at the main express carriers. The 2018 LPI data are based on a survey conducted between September 2017 and February 2018, answered by 869 respondents at international logistics companies in 108 countries. Geographic dispersion of respondents Among the respondents, 62 percent are in either low income countries (3 percent) or middle-income countries (59 percent). The overall number is similar to the 2016 LPI, but this year there are relatively many more contri- butions from upper-middle-income countries. The lack of representation of low income coun- tries is due to their more marginal role in world trade, and the difficulty of communicating effectively with operators on the ground (fig- ure A6.1). Among developing countries, all regions are well represented, especially Latin America and Caribbean (figure A6.2). Increasing involve- ment of local associations and operators will hopefully help build response rates in the future in other regions. Respondents’ positions in their companies The LPI assesses both large companies and small and medium enterprises. Large companies (those with 250 employees or more) account for around 29 percent of responses, which is higher than in 2016. Most of the responses are thus from small and medium enterprises.

fewer than in 2016), area or country managers (13 percent), and department managers (19 per- cent). These groups of professionals have over- sight of, or are directly involved in, day-to-day operations, not only from company headquar- ters but also from country offices. The relative seniority of respondents has slightly decreased from 2016 to 2018. Two-thirds of respon- dents are at corporate or regional headquar- ters (39 percent) or at country branch offices (26 percent). The rest are at local branch offices (10 percent) or independent firms (25 percent). 43 percent of respondents are involved in providing a large range of logistics services as their main line of work. Such services include warehousing and distribution, customer-tai- lored logistics solutions, courier services, bulk or break-bulk cargo transport, and less- than- full-container, full-container, or full-trailer load transport. 38 percent of respondents are at companies with business models based on full- container or full-trailer load transport (24 per- cent) or on customer-tailored logistics solutions (14 percent). These shares have converged as compared to 2016. Among all respondents, 35 percent deal with multimodal transport, 25 percent with maritime transport, and 13 percent with air transport. These last two numbers are similar to the 2016 ones, while the number of respon- dents dealing with multimodal transport has gone down. In 2018, 6 percent of respondents handle domestic trade, and 53 percent deal with exports or imports. Finally, 26 percent work with most of the world’s regions, while others concentrate their work in Europe (34 percent), Asia (19 percent), the Americas (14 percent), Africa (4 percent), or the Middle East (3 percent). Hardly any work with Australia and the Pacific (3 respondents). 64 C O N N E C T I N G T O C O M P E T E 2 0 18 T R A D E L O G I S T I C S I N T H E G L O B A L E C O N O M Y

What is the Logistics Performance Index? Based on a worldwide survey of global freight forwarders and express carriers, the Logistics Performance Index is a benchmarking tool developed by the World Bank that measures performance along the logistics supply chain within a country. Allowing for comparisons across 167 countries, the index can help countries identif y challenges and opportunities and improve their logistics performance. The World Bank conducts the survey every two years. Reliable logistics is indispensable to integrate global value chains—and reap the beneﬁt of trade opportunities for growth and poverty reduction. The ability to connect to the global logistics web depends on a country’s infrastructure, service markets, and trade processes. Government and the private sector in many developing countries should improve these areas—or face the large and growing costs of exclusion. This is the sixth edition of Connecting to Compete, a report summarizing the ﬁndings from the new dataset for the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) and its component indicators. The 2018 LPI also provides expanded data on supply chain performance and constraints in more than 100 countries, including information on time, distance and reliability, and ratings on domestic infrastructure quality, services, and border agencies. The 2018 LPI encapsulates the ﬁrsthand knowledge of movers of international trade. This information is relevant for policymakers and the private sector seeking to identify reform priorities for “soft” and “hard” trade and logistics infrastructure. Findings include: • Gaps in logistics performance between the bottom and top performers persist. • • • Supply chain reliability and service quality are strongly associated with logistics performance. Infrastructure and trade facilitation initiatives still play an important role in assuring basic connectivity and access to gateways for most developing countries. The logistics policy agenda continues to broaden, with growing focus on supply chain resilience, cyber security, environmental sustainability, and skills shortages. 2018 Connecting to Compete Trade Logistics in the Global Economy The Logistics Performance Index and Its Indicators
